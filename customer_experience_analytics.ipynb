It should be noted that there are two models- the one I have with the \"s\" at the end, meaning a straight cable and also the coiled cable model. Every other aspect of the headphones are the same between models.The build quality of the headphones is quite nice. They take general abuse well. They only issue I have had at all is the stress-relief coil on the headphone cable by the 1/8\" jack pulled out of the connector. This is probably easily fixable and I have not contacted AT to fix it, but I\\'m sure they would be quite helpful judging by past experience with customer support. The fold up and are solid once done so. The vinyl pouch doesn\\'t do much more than keep them clean and protected from scratches, but it is still nice. I\\'m not worried that these headphones will break under normal usage.As for comfort, these headphones are made to be worn for long periods of time. I\\'ve worn them for hours and fallen asleep in them no problem. They are large enough to completely cover your ears without squishing them. Others who have tried my pair on have agreed; often times you forget you\\'re even wearing them.The sound quality is the most impressive part. These things sound amazing! They have nice, crisp highs and clean mids. The bass is fantastic; I have never had a pair of headphones that has such strong bass. For the price (often little more than $100 street), I have not tried a pair of headphones that comes close to quality. The clarity of the headphones on even sources like iPods pumping mp3s is incredible. I use them for everything from their intended use with pro audio applications to casually listening to music.I would not hesitate recommending these headphones to anyone looking for a nice pair in the $100-200 price range. They are comfortable, sound great, and are priced nicely. If you are looking for a pair of solid headphones, look no further- you\\'ve found them.'},\n",

Out of the box these were kind of disappointing but don't get put off by that they turn into amazing headphones after about 30 hours of wearing them. At first the clamping force was too strong(but then again these are studio headphones and they need that for sound isolation, not the same as noise canceling in case your wondering) but it wears off after 30+ hours of use. They still have the noise isolation but you can wear then longer without them hurting you. Now I can listen to them for about 3 hours without any fatigue. Also, at first there sound was kind off disappointing, there bass was kind of off and the mids sounded to recessed along with the highs. After time though the sound sounded less recessed, the bass was a lot better at make soft bass and hard bass sound like it should and the overall quality of sound had much improved. A couple of cons though are that there a little to big and the cable is too long but you are getting a great deal for the price. I  definitely recommend these if your price range is 150-200. If you have 250 dollars to spare, you can find better but these are just unbeatable. This pair of cans also looks like it will last me for many years to come. Also before I forget they arrived 2 days early bringing back the star I originally has thought about taking off due to there first impression.\"},\n",

Right out of the box, the first thing I noticed is how crisp the highs sound! It was seriously unbelievable. The mids were a little recessed at first, and I\\'ve only given them about 5 hours of burn in, and I can tell the difference already. Everything sounds so clear on this headphones, and as other reviewers have already said plenty of times, I love to hear the sounds of the songs as they were intended to sound in the first place. And that\\'s exactly what I get with these babies.About the comfortability, I felt they were a little tight at first, and I don\\'t think they\\'re quite 100% comfortable yet, but it\\'s improving, and I\\'ve read before that they stretch and \"get used\" to your head until you don\\'t even feel they\\'re there anymore. We\\'ll see what happens in the next few weeks. I don\\'t think this is necessarily a bad thing because the sound quality I get with these headphones makes me forget about that. Seriously. Plus, it isn\\'t really bad, so I almost don\\'t care.I still haven\\'t watched a movie with these, but as soon as I do, I\\'ll post an update. I\\'ll write about the comfortability in the future too.All the hype that is around about these headphones, their amazing sound quality and accuracy, it\\'s all true. If you are reading this, it\\'s because you\\'ve read a lot more on the web, and are still hesitant or looking for more people to tell you that these are the best headphones you will get for this price. I don\\'t know a lot about headphones, but I\\'ve read maaany times that you would have to pay around $400 or more to get better headphones than these. And if you have a budget similar to mine to buy headphones, that won\\'t happen anytime soon.Just buy them now already. Me, and hundreds of other reviewers you\\'ve already seen, promise you won\\'t regret it.--- > UPDATE AS OF 11/20/2011:Guys, these headphones just sound great. Nothing else to say, the bottom frequencies are probable a little bit recessed, but for a basshead, and I still enjoy my music like this. Sound quality is superb with movies, tv shows, and everything I listen to on these babies.Now, I had 5 stars before on this review, but I had to take 1 star off just because of the comfortability. On my head they feel a bit tight, to the point where it\\'s almost annoying. There are days when they don\\'t bother me, and others where I do feel like taking them off after only a few mins of listening. If it wasn\\'t for this, I\\'d stay with them for a while. For the moment, I\\'m considering the Beyerdynamic DT770s, 80 ohms, which have 10x more comfortability, according to EVERY comparison I\\'ve read online of these 2 pairs of headphones. Too bad, because these DO sound amazing!'},\n",

I shopped around a lot before purchasing this particular model. The sound is great. I bought the coiled cord model, and like the fact that there is only one wire coming out of the left ear piece rather than like my other headphones, one wire out of each earpiece that meet in the middle. My only gripe and it is a small one, is that there is a little bit of extra weight to the headphones and there is no padding in the middle of the headphone. Unless I adjust them to sit above the top of my head, space between the headphone and my scalp, the headphone gets heavy if it sits on my scalp, and can be irritating. My other headphones have more padding and can sit right on the top of my head. Other than that, having to consciously set the headphones on my head, I really love these headphones.

       "  'review': 'And the winner is...  I have been comparing both the ATH-M50\\'s to the HD-25\\'s for a week.  I returned the Grado\\'s after a few days, as explained below, but they are a good value.  Unlike the Grado\\'s, both the HD25 and M50 are closed-back; at medium volumes they won\\'t disturb others nearby.  After about 24 hours of break-in with each headphone (the ATHM50\\'s definitely required a break in period of 24 hours), the ATH-M50\\'s sound better:  they are more balanced, have a wider sound stage, and to my ear, the musical sources (instruments) in each range are more distinct and clear and the tone of the instruments sounds \"more correct\" than in the HD-25\\'s.  That said, each headphone has its place and I may keep both the M50 and the HD25.  If I had choose between one, I would keep the HD25\\'s because... the HD25\\'s are portable and are compatible with your mobile device/ipod.  I would look silly walking out of my house in the M50\\'s, with its big headband and earmuffs and long coiled cord, not to mention that M50\\'s are heavier, not just heavier looking, although if you are out and about wearing the HD25, people may still stance glance at you with curious expressions and not because you are a fashion icon.  The HD25, as you can see in the pictures of it, has smaller ear cups with wires popping up out of them; they also have a much shorter, NON-coiled cord compared to the ATHM50\\'s.  Still, the M50\\'s have a noticeably wider sound stage (maybe due to their larger cups, which are about twice the size?) and, as I stated above, are more distinct in both the mid range and bass, whereas the HD-25, as others have mentioned, are muddier, which is a little disappointing, but I\\'ll get over it since in the outside environment with ambient noise, I\\'m sure that I would hardly notice anyway.  BOTH are driven well through portable devices (currently testing them on a new ipad shuffle, among other sources).  I wouldn\\'t walk out of my house with M50\\'s, but I\\'ll put them on when I\\'m home, and there is a side of me that says if I\\'m listening at home, maybe I should invest in (another) amp and instead buy an even higher-end Sennheiser headphone, such as the HD 595, 600 or 650\\'s.  It\\'s only money.  So, the decision is really one of how you will use your headphones and how much value you will gain from incrementally improved headphone performance.  The Grado\\'s were priced much less than the two headphones above; they also had much less response on the lower and high ends, or more precisely, the Grados were missing the low end and were hissy on the high end, although in the middle they were very good and I liked the way that they SR80i foam cushioning formed to my ears; they were very comfortable.  The Grado\\'s had open backs and weren\\'t suitable for privacy or use in an office or other close-quartered environment.  Since I couldn\\'t see using the Grado\\'s for portability or in the office, and out of the box, both the M50\\'s and HD-25\\'s were clearly superior (albeit 60% and 100% more money, respectively), I returned the Grados.  For the bargain basement value shopper, for about $25, you can buy the Sennheiser HS-202, which are pretty good for that price.'},\n",

       "  'review': \"THE BASS ON THESE, THO.This would be my first headset that's set me back more than $40, so I'm curious to see how long they will last. My last pair of Sennheiser 203s pooped out in one ear, which is what led me to doing research on a better cabled + great sounding set of headphones. I edit video and listen to music casually, so my purchase had to supplement my little street-ready earbuds for semi-professional audio monitoring purposes. Initially I was looking at the Shure 440 (http://www.amazon.com/Shure-SRH440-Professional-Studio-Headphones/dp/B002DP1FTU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1393351451&sr;=8-1&keywords;=shure+440), which was much cheaper. But these had better reviews in comparisons of the two models in regard to sound quality, so I took the plunge.PROS:- Great cord! This was my primary concern, as the cord on my Senns was very thin/dinky and frayed out -- to my disappointment as they were a nice sounding set for my purposes. The M50s cord is a bit thicker than an average wired mouse cord, and has a cool little metal spring reinforcement on the plug. The end that attaches to the right can is also nicely reinforced and feels like it will protect whatever wiring is inside. I will still make sure to wrap these babies veeery carefully. Because I'm paranoid.- Durable design! These cans are surprisingly heavy, which gives the headset an overall durable feel and not a cheap, plasticky feel. The cans themselves are comfortably snug around your head, and are flexible without feeling like they'll snap in two. The metal accent on the cans themselves is also a super nice aesthetic touch that makes it worth the price. I read a few complaints about the earpads, but I don't find them that miserable. They're typical pleather (prone to a slightly sticky feel) and look like they will probably need to be replaced after a few months or a half year, but they're actually fairly comfortable and have a nice weight to them. However I will look into purchasing another differently styled earpad set as a backup and for fun to see how much different the cans will feel on my ears. Otherwise, the earpads are great.- Pure, rich sound for under $200! This is my first pricey set of phones, and the praise definitely holds true. The cups completely engulf my ears, which creates this cool surround-sound effect. Movies and music videos all capture a little bit of that cinematic audio vibe that you normally experience in theaters or in quiet rooms that carry sound well. Music is rich and clear, basses thump without being obnoxious and little sounds you didn't hear with those $10 earbuds or the previous cheaper headset subtly make their way to the surface. Surprisingly. they are immensely noise cancelling. Not to the (I personally find jarring) extent of some of Bose's higher end fancy noise isolating sets, but they muffle out ambient sound kind of in the manner of someone gently cupping their hands over your ears.The sound is so rich and fresh, I have a hard time taking them off!CONS- The cord isn't swappable -- which would be a cool feature on these, BUUUUT it is a feature on the update of this model (http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATH-M50x-Professional-Headphones/dp/B00HVLUR86/ref=dp_ob_title_ce) so for like $20 more, you can swap out your cord and be ensured of the headsets longevity. No big deal. :) I'm pretty happy with these so far though, so I'll hang back on that.Overall, great set. The hype is true. A rarity under $200, the ATH M50s are great set of cans for your various audiophile/professional audio monitoring needs. Crossing my fingers that this cord will prove to be up to muster (thus the missing fifth star...;) )\"},\n",

Unless you make money with your headphones (or have money to burn) you probably don\\'t need anything better than the M50\\'s. The only thing I would change would be to get rid of the collapsible cans - they make the headphones take up less room when folded (good for travelling) but I\\'m old fashioned and prefer rigid phones, they are a bit quicker to get on and off when you don\\'t have to unfold them and flip the cans in the right orientation.

On the other hand the Studio's are more comfortable and have noise isolation that you won't find on the AT's.

My budget was $200 and after very extensive research (Head-fi, Amazon etc.) it seemed like these were the best cans for my budget.On first listening, I was pretty disappointed.  The sound just seemed a bit muffled compared to my Sony's.  So I decided to burn them in for about 3 days straight at normal listening volume.  After burn in, there was a huge improvement in sound.  The bass was punchy but clear, highs where crisp without being harsh and the mids were good enough for my needs (rock/hip-hop), but are a bit recessed if you listen to quieter vocal stuff which is not my cup of tea anyway.  I wouldn't worry too much about the mids, they are clear and not distorted.The sound separation / sound stage were excellent and noticeably better than my Sony's.  Instruments definitely had better separation between them than the V6's.  My V6's sound messy by comparison.  I cannot go back to my V6's which I still think are the best cans for under $100.  But if your budget is $200 max, I don't think you can find a better pair of headphones.  Heck even Dr. Dre uses them (pics on google). (Don't buy Beats.  Even Dre. knows they're no good).I did have concerns about comfort issues as many reviewers here have mentioned.  They do fit tight at first, so I just stretched them out over a couple of books while they were burning in for 3 days.  I wear glasses and normally get headaches easily, but I've been able to wear these at work at least 2 to 3 hours comfortably.  Over 3 hours and I'll notice some sweat from my ears, but nothing major.  You should take a break after 2 to 3 hours anyway.Sound: 5/5Comfort: 4/5Value: 5/5\"},\n",

So  when you listen to songs, let use \"Hey Jude\" by The Beatles for example. The headphones literally dissect the entire song to separate instruments, you can clearly hear every single instrument there is. At one point i even thought Paul McCartney was singing right next to my ears. For Mids and Highs, its just too perfect to be true. Same goods for the bass.

With clean silver accents and a simple black colour, these are some of the most professional looking cans I have ever seen.These are the single most comfortable pair of truly &#34;over ear&#34; headphones I have ever worn! The headphones feature a multitude of different adjustments. I won't go into to much detail however I will say if you are a fan of having one ear cup off (dj style) these are ridiculously comfortable in the position as well.The sound of these headphones steps it up another level from the looks. If I had to give one word to summarise these headphones it would be &#34;all-round&#34; (one word :P ). These headphones could easily be used in professional monitoring situations, however are not so flat sounding that they take the fun out of your jams. I listen to a wide range of music and find that everything from classical strings to dubstep can sound great from the M50's however not always straight off the bat. Two things that need to be done to get the most out of these headphones in a purely listening form are: 1. Burn them in for about 60 hours, this doesn't necessarily mean using white or pink noise but even just listening to them. 2. use some EQ! I don't mean go crazy, but a touch of EQ on these phones can take them from monitor flat to ear rattling bass canons in a heartbeat.I highly recommend these headphones to anyone looking for an all-round set of sturdy, clear, comfortable headphones... especially first time high end users... these really are the way to go!\"},\n",

Absolutely brilliant design with many degrees of freedom to accommodate heads of all shapes and sizes.The top band could be less tensioned. I will try to install them on a PC case for a day to see if I can lower the top band's tension a little bit. This issue becomes an annoying problem after about 3 to 4 hours of constant wearing. Increasing the number of notches to offset the tension will not work because the headphone are too heavy to stay on the ears without support from the top band. Heavy is a relative term. These are still fairly light headphones.Any amount of sweat will cause a small yet noticeable amount of sticking to the head, but this isn't as important as the issue with the tension causing a big headache after several solid hours. I am still unsure if a small amount of baby powder will damage the material, but it may be just what the doctor ordered.Ease of use 4.5/5Clumsy users may have a tiny bit of trouble with these headphones when folding them to store them. If you never store them, this is a non-issue.Sound quality 5/5Extremely accurate and precise. I have not been able to push enough power to bottom out any of the drivers yet either. Good sound cards and amplifiers are a must. Listening to 128 kbps MP3s is painful because the muddy sound quality is blatantly apparent. It is much easier to distinguish between 128, ~200, and 320+ kbps together with lossless files than anything else I have heard under $200. Much better than the Sennheisers in a similar price range, which I found to have a boomy bass and warm midrange that I do not enjoy. These seem to deliver a more cold and precise sound. The bass is extremely tight and as other reviewers mention, it does get a lot better progressively over 100 hours or so of listening. The sound stage also considerably develops over this time period.Other reviewers have a lot more to say about this and I do.Construction Quality 5/5As far as I can tell it is made from a tough plastic resin and I have had no problems with it thus far.Portability 5/5Very lightweight and cable can be tied up to shorten its length.Just my 2 cents in 2 minutes.\"},\n",

I would buy these again in an instant, and I\\'ve already recommended them to many people.I made the leap from $20 headphones to $100 headphones years ago with a pair of Bose over-the-ear headphones. I loved how they handled my music, from techno to metal, and was disappointed when they broke after only a few years of light use. Last year I settled for a pair of $40 Skull Candy\\'s, they seemed comparable, less quality but not drastically over the Bose, and at $40 and a lifetime warranty I thought it was a steal; until the wiring went bad after 10 months, requiring me to send them in. I didn\\'t want this to be a repeat pattern, no matter how good a year warranty sounds.Before taking a risk on this pair, I went to a store and tested the latest Bose ($140) and Beats by Dr. Dre ($200+). Between the two, I think the Beats performed better than the Bose, but not by a $100 margin. I then did my homework and it was a decision between a pair of Audio Technica\\'s or Sennheiser. After reading about 15 reviews, they all pointed to the Audio Technica\\'s for the value they bring at $120. I couldn\\'t agree more.I listen to a wide variety of music, from techno, to death metal, to classical, to indie, to rock. Having a pair of headphones that can handle ALL of these genres is difficult to find. The headphones usually are too bassy, or too trebley. These are well balanced for all of the types of music. I can hear the fast double-bass defined in these headphones, and DeadMau5 still thumps just fine. Reference headphones are meant to provide you with true sounds, not amplifying certain ones. If I want my music more bass heavy, I can adjust the equalizer, I don\\'t need it built into the headphones, which in the end becomes a nuisance because I would have to adjust my headphones to a \"normal\" setting every time.'},\n",

There is another version that comes with a coiled cable and usually sells for a few bucks more, but the \\'phones are identical.These headphones have been on the market for many years and have always received high ratings.  They can be purchased for much less than the current \"fad\" headphones.  I want to hear music and don\\'t care about style.  These are for use at my desktop computer, playing through a SoundBlaster Audigy card and through a Hi Fi receiver, playing vinyl records from a Dual turntable with a Shure cartridge.  The desktop computer does not produce a strong signal (amplifier in a sound card is not exactly an audiophile\\'s dream source of sound) but it is good enough for these \\'phones to make very listenable, wide-range, loud enough sound.  Through an audiophile amplifier or receiver they are incredible for the money.  They are comfortable, but if you wear glasses, eventually they will start to hurt around the ears.  They are a little sweaty after a couple hours.  The cord is too long and gets caught under a chairs wheels or around the armrests if you are not careful. That\\'s the only reason I didn\\'t give 5 stars.  I have yet to find earphones or headphones that I would rate at 5 stars.  For sound quality, alone, you can\\'t do better unless you buy headphones that cost 2-5 times more.  If they came with a removable cable and two lengths, they would be close to perfect. A newer model ATH-M50x, does come with a removable cable and although it can\\'t be bought for as much of a discount as the M50S, I should have ordered the newer model.  M50S can be bought for about $120-130.  M50C costs about $10-15 more.  M50x costs $170-190.'},\n",

The bass is tight and, compared to the HD-280s, it feels like there is a sub-woofer near your ears. The other frequencies are also very accurate and clear. I can hear tiny details in the music that I didn't hear before.The ATH-M50s do need some break-in time.  Out of the box, I thought they sounded awful. The bass was okay, but the mids and highs were diminished and a little muddy. After using them for a few hours I heard a noticeable difference; all the frequencies settled into place and became much more transparent.Two complaints: (1) needs a slightly longer cord and (2) isolation is not as good as the HD-280s.  Isolation is fine for blocking out the environment, but in quiet areas everyone would be able to tell what you're listening to.These headphones are a terrific value!  Very much worth the price.\"},\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ve had these headphones for only a week, but I have already done a decent amount of burn-in for these. These are not my first quality headphones as I\\'ve previously owned a Sennheiser HD 280 as well as Klipsch Image S4 earbuds. Short story short, I had my Sennhesier HD 280s for about 6 years already, and thought that it wouldn\\'t hurt to look for a new pair of quality headphones as I\\'m a big music person. I pretty much listen to all music genres except for dub\"wub\"step, electronic variants, and country music.Sound Quality:Now on to the review of the headphones, these headphones are nothing short of amazing. I thought that my hd 280s were already good enough, however upon letting the m50s warm up for a good hour or so, the clarity and lows were noticeably better. The mids and the highs were just as good. For the other reviews that comment about its impressive bass, I would like to add that the bass is quite deep, yet refined at the same time. So if you want a more \"boomy\" bass for your ears, these are not the headphones for you. However, for a guy like me that doesn\\'t want too much bass and listens to a lot of classical music, these headphones are great. I can hear the instruments as the sound is very clear and especially for those that are a fan of violin concertos accompanied by a full orchestra, these pair of headphones really shine. For underground hip hop music, you can hear the background instrumentals well, while being able to hear the artist just as well.I would like to note, that if you download music off of youtube via youtube to mp3 software, you will notice the huge difference in music quality with these headphones. Thus, I suggest to really buy music CDs (have a decently big classical music collection) as you will really hear the full potential of the m50s that way. For those that concerned with how well it does with mp3 players and smartphones, I would happily like to say that these headphones work great (this was not so much the case for the Senn HD280s, so props to audio technica).Now for a minor issue, for some music genres, mainly rock and pop music, you will notice that some instruments might sound kind of faint and notice some \"recessed\" mids. Although it is quite minor, it can be noticed if you pay close attention. However, after listening to the m50s for 30 hours or so, this became less of an issue. For those that are bothered by recessed mids and want possibly a flatter sound, the Shure 840s might be a better choice for some (looks-wise is a bit outdated though).Comfort:Now this is unfortunately somewhat of a mixed bag to me. On one hand, it fits well and covers my ears. However, after two or so hours of constant use, my head and ears will start feeling tired from the small pressure points experienced while wearing these headphones. Another thing to take note of as other reviewers have already mentioned, your ears start to get hot after 30 minutes of use. Thus, I would recommend people that decide to buy these pair of headphones to take them off for a minute or two every thirty minutes. Other than these two small, but noticeable issues, this doesn\\'t really affect the great listening experience.Build Quality:The build quality to the m50s are top notch. I won\\'t go too much detail in this area as others have already noted its build quality properties, but the one word I would go to describe the m50s build quality is: solid. Every feels refined, with the nice audio technica logo, the strong metal head-band, and most notably the spring that covers the cord near the end of the headphone connector.Price:There was a time where you could get the m50s as low as around $100. Unfortunately due to the growing popularity and huge praise that the m50s get from the general audiophile community, Audio Technica has since then decided to raise the price to around $150. Even at $150, there are not too many other alternatives I would consider. If I were a consumer considering the m50s, I would wait till they are around $135, which is the price I paid these for. Other alternatives that others may consider that are cheaper are the Shure 840s, grado sr80i, Koss dj series (get the ones just under $100). Other note-worthy brands are Sennheiser, Beyerdynamic, Ultrasone, Roland, Firscher, Phiaton, Denon, but their good headphone models are moreso in the $200 and up range.Overall (90/100):These headphones deserve the praise that it gets constantly among the audiophile community as these are truly great sounding headphones. The lows, mids, and highs are all great and the sound is quite flat with the only minor issue being slight recessed mids. For those that want quality headphones around $150 and want to listen to how music was supposed to sound like. The jump from the Sennheiser HD 280s to the m50s are a noticeable albeit not a big jump going from terrible stock apple earbuds to the Senn HD 280s. If you already have decent quality headphones like the HD280s, you may want to consider keeping those until they are around 5 or so years old (ear pads start to get really worn out). Thus, I would recommend knowing what exactly your allowable price range is. For the other note-worthy brands that I listed under the \"Price\" section of this review, be wary that you will be paying quite a bit more. If you\\'re an average joe like me that wants to listen to music clearly with good lows, mids, and highs, and do not care too much for soundstage or replicating \"concert\" quality sound with all the other expensive sound equipment needed to do so, then the m50s are the headphones for you. Overall, I highly recommend these headphones to anyone who have only had $50 and under headphones. For those that already have quality $100 and up headphones like the Senn HD 2808s, it may not be totally worth it.'},\n",

       "  'review': 'Simply put, these are the perfect set of cans. At least for me anyway. I tried a few different pairs before landing on these. The JVC HARX900, and the Sennheiser HD280Pro\\'s. The JVC just had WAY too much sound leakage for work and I felt that while the bass was very good and pronounced, and the highs were a little harsh. Overall the soundstage was decent, given the open design, but they didn\\'t seem balanced. The Sennheisers performed well for me for a few years. Well balanced, crisp and clear, but pretty weak on the lows. The design was great though, comfortable and traveled well. The same can not be said of the JVC\\'s. The Sennheisers broke, and I returned the JVCs for the above mentioned issues.Enter the Audiotechnica M50s. Right away I like the look of them. They don\\'t look silly at all. Professional and comfortable. A little warm over the ears, but this is a very minor issue. I can wear these all day on and off. The cans tilt, and swivel making it easy to rest them around the neck or pack them into a bag. The cord is solid, and the jack is industrial grade. The design is just solid all around.The sound quality is easily the best I have heard thus far. Extremely accurate. The highs are not harsh at all. Very crisp and precise. The bass is perfect. And the mid-range has a great separation from the highs and lows. Not overwhelming like Sony or Beats, these have the right amount of bass. As intended by the artist or mixer. You can always boost your bass with an amp or EQ which I did with a few test tracks (Infected Mushroom, NIN, Morcheeba etc.). They handled the boost admirably and I was really suprised with how much punch these had. But I kept the EQ level on some lossless acoustic Johnny Cash and a few other acoustic recordings and the detail is just amazing. I have been combing through my music testing these out for the last month and I\\'m REALLY impressed. So many subtle sounds I rarely picked up on unless I really cranked these tunes on my home theater system. These are just about as good or better in some ways as being able to crank that home theater to extreme volumes. But the beauty is don\\'t have to wake the neighborhood to enjoy these. I love these headphones. And I really feel its worth the money for something I will use everyday for years.Sidenote: I lost my 1/4\" adapter for these shortly after receiving the product. This was sad because it meant I couldn\\'t plug in to my monitor or my amp. I emailed Audio Technica and they happily sent me a new one free of charge. Highly recommend buying these, or any Audio Technica product based on this great experience.'},\n",

This may be a mishmosh of items, but it's all i've tried so far.  The Razer Megalodon, the Logitech Premium USB headset, the Audio Technica ATH-ANC7, and finally these.This may be the first set of headphones that I've tried out specifically designed for music playback, however that doesn't change anything in the least.  These are incredibly clear, (I've tried this headset with music at 1.5kbps .wma lossless) and the soundstage is quite large, though it probably would be larger on an open set of cans.  Like other reviewers have said, the bass isn't quite dominant initially, though I don't doubt that it will improve after long burn-in times.  Compared to the Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7, these are much clearer, and the bass is much similar.  The ATH-ANC7 was developed with noise-cancellation in mind, so it is difficult to compare audio quality, as the functions are different.  The overall designs are similar, so the passive noise-cancelling works similarly, giving these headphones good isolation.  To the Megalodons, which is a scary headset btw, these still have better sound quality, the Megalodons were a bit muffled, although they were excellent in game, obviously superior to the ATH-M50.  If it weren't for a few design flaws in the Megalodon, I would have gone with those because I like to have that kind of edge in gaming.  I digress.  These are obviously better than the logitechs.Anyway, this may not be a particularly good review in the sound quality area.  The construction is very solid, all the way to the heavy metal plug.  One aspect that I like is their WIDE range of motion.  Each earpad can turn 180, allowing them to rest flatly on your chest or desk when not in use.  They are also able to fold up into the headpad, which is better illustrated in different images on the website.  The packaging is simple, and the headphones come with the highly useful 1/4inch plug.  It also comes with a synthetic leather-type carrying bag.  I mostly use it for my PC, and I haven't tried them on a plane yet, though I don't expect anything bad.Pros:-Great sound-Good range of motion-Durable design-Stylish-Low impedanceCons:-Can get a bit hot after long sessions-Tight fit on my head, personally\"},\n",

This led to a need for a second set of headphones, efficient enough to use without a headphone amp. And this time I wanted closed-back for monitoring recordings, and preferably with a 1/8\" jack.I first bought the  ATHM40FS, due to the positive reviews & great price. Unfortunately, they went back the next day. Yes, I didn\\'t let them break-in for a long time, perhaps no more than 6 hours. But that was long enough for me to judge that they would never be ideal for me. Their sound was much too thin, bright, & cool for my tastes. I don\\'t pretend to know what those touting \"flat\" are looking for. For me the acid test is: does it sound like the real thing? And if you have ever heard a real cello playing in your living room, you\\'ll know that the sound of the real thing can be full bodied & rich, with deeply satisfying bass resonance. Cellos did not sound anything like that through these phones - to my ears. Before returning them, however, I had my wife listen. Like many women, she is much more sensitive to high frequencies than I am. After a few minutes, she judged them unlistenable:  too bright for her also.I know more break-in would improve this, and that many people actually like this type of sound, so it\\'s not a criticism - just part of the search for what sounds best to our own ears.  I then chose to look much more carefully at the online reviews, reading between the lines where necessary, and ultimately decided to try the ATH-M50s.For those comparing the two, they are nowhere near such a bargain. They cost almost 2.5 times as much, when I bought them. But right out of the box they sounded much richer & warmer, without the treble emphasis which can bother some of us.  Listening via the modest headphone amp in my Dell laptop, they sound as good as the HD 600s. When the Sennheisers are used through the my ASL headphone Amp they, however, move into another league (to my ears). I found the ATH-M50s to be very listenable from day one: warm enough, detailed enough, with great bass, and, in my case, well worth the difference in price. I chose the coiled cable version, which I prefer for mobile listening. And they come with a 1/8 mini plug, screwed into a 1/4\" plug.  Perfect for use with portable player or amp.'},\n",

However, these seem like just about the cheapest high-quality over-ear headphones, and the sound quality they produce does not disappoint.  The bass sounds solid, and the middle and high are very clear.  The phones are extremely comfortable, and although they seem like they don't fold up as much as some other headphones might, they're just fine.  The carrying case is included.Pros:- Great sound- I'm confident people can't hear what I'm listening to, even at high volume- Very comfortable- Quite cheapCons:- My ears begin to steam up a little with prolonged use- They're not totally noise-canceling like I imagine real noise-canceling headphones would be.\"},\n",

Not really  complaint, just something to be aware of.These are the best headphones I've ever owned. The startling thing is how *balanced* they are. If you listen to a lot of bass-heavy music, a lot of headphones just rumble and drown everything out. On these headphones, you can hear the bass, but you can *actually* hear all the mids and highs just as well. Its something I had read before in other reviews, but I was still blown away the first time I used them.Also, these headphones seem to sound even better after a few weeks of use. I think the drivers need to be broken in. Dont get me wrong: they sound great on day one, but they sound better and better the more you use them.They are pretty large (bulky), but they're very comfortable; the padding is the right level of soft, and I dont feel tired or sore after wearing them all day.I've been recommending these to anyone who will listen. They are hands down the best headphone I've ever used. I would gladly pay twice what I did ($130) and be just as happy.\"},\n",

They have been worth every single penny and I continually recommend them to anyone who will listen.The sound quality is amazing. I really don't know how else to describe it. It's amazing that these can make such good bass without an external power source (amp) and yet still retain all of the highs and mids.They're also super comforable. As I said I wear them for 8-12 hours a day while I work and it's very rare that either my ears or the top of my head gets sore. They're fully adjustable in height and they don't press inwards on your head very much at all.Also be aware that they block out noise extremely well. This is great for noisy environments but whenever I travel with them, say in an airport, I have to remind myself that I won't be able to hear announcements with them on and music playing. Something to keep in mind if you need to be able to hear things other than your music.They work great with my iPhone as well although some cases can get in the way of the wide plug.

Headphones I own or owned ranging from cheap street vendor earbuds, iPod earbuds, Sony MDR-V150, AKG K77, Koss PortaPro, Koss QZ99 to this Audio-Technica ATH-M50.Due to loss of hearing, I had to turn volume high for those cheap Coby & JVC, and even iPod earbuds.  But, for ATH-M50, medium is enough.  With ATH-M50, those pre-set equalizers in iPod do make differences when listening to different kinds of music.  Compared to AKG K77, ATH-M50 makes much more clear sound, especially, in highs.  I am not going to compare ATH-M50 with Koss QZ99 since QZ99 is more for noise-reduction to me.  PortaPro is quite close to ATH-M50 in term of sound clarity.  If you own Koss PortaPro, you may want to buy a pair of ATH-M50 for living room or sound room listening.Audio-Technica ATH-M50 headphones to some might be an overkill for listening to iPods.

       "  'review': 'I am not an audiophile. I\\'m barely totally certain what that term means. I am a college student that wanted headphones under $150 that offered me the best sound and comfort. The Audio-Technica ATH-M50s do just that.Initially, I bought theSony MDR-V55/BR DJ style Headphonesbecause they produced great sound with extra bass. I didn\\'t know I was really an extra bass sort of guy, but listening to the Sonys, I discovered that I was. The problem with the V55s was how uncomfortable they got after only 20 minutes or half an hour of listening. They squeeze your head (mainly because they are DJ style on ear headphones- meant to squeeze more than other over-head headphones).Anyway, after I found those so uncomfortable, I began searching for the perfect headphones. I read a ton of great reviews for the ATH M50s and decided to just jump in and buy them- best decision I could have made.The audio quality is superb, regardless of what kind of music you listen to. They definitely offer me enough bass and the clarity of mid and high frequencies is just as amazing. I\\'ve tried Bose AE2s, since they are also around-the-ear headphones and they sound too shrill and sharp, lacking the bass the ATH-M50s provide.These headphones are comfortable, provide amazing sound, and beat headphones of the likes of Dr. Dre Beats (had to mention those, because I know a lot of people want to know how they compare. Beats are overpriced and sound like crap in comparison to these headphones. Buy them only if you want style points. Even then, why waste $200-$400 on any kind of beats when you can have the better sound with these Audio-Technicas?).IN CONCLUSION:I got these because I wanted headphones that I can sit down with and rediscover my music- it feels like I\\'m listening to everything for the first time and discovering so many more layers of sound that I had missed before with cheaper headphones and ear buds.If you\\'re worried they won\\'t have enough bass, don\\'t. I EQ mine with my iPad/iPhone to \"Rock\" and they add a little punchier bass if you need it. Also, I\\'ve read after 40 hours or so of use, they start sounding even better- this I can\\'t even imagine as they already sound so good.They\\'re comfortable (I\\'ve actually been wearing them for over 2 hours with no problems) they sound amazing and they\\'re affordable.Don\\'t think, just buy.'},\n",

       "  'review': \"I gotta say, these headphones sound really good. I have some KRK studio headphones I spent a bit more on, and while those do offer a more flat sound, these really do sound comparable with a bit more bottom end to them. I also have a more expensive pair of Sennheiser 595s that I strongly feel these ATs sound better than. I do like a little more bass though, so perhaps that is why. I will also so for those who like Beats, these sound better than the 3 different pairs of Beats I tried. They have better bass than their mid level headphones and not as bassy (which in this case is a good thing) as the top of the line Beats but better sound quality. In other words, these head phones seem to have the right balance of good bass plus mids and highs.If there is one thing I might knock a minor point off for.. they are quite tight on my head... but then they are made to avoid any sound leakage out too, so that is typically the way these sorts of cans feel.By the way, there is a newer version of these headphones... with an X in it's name, and sound wise there is no difference. You get a couple of minor features for about $70 more than these go for.. in my opinion it's not worth the extra money if you can live without a removable cord and optional colors. In fact, I am myself about to try a FiiO headphone amp (E12) that would probably be better putting your money towards and getting these than the X model.\"},\n",

I replaced them with a pair of $400 Senneheisers (PBX 310BT) because I wanted to try wireless and bluetooth in a high quality pair of headphones. The Sennheisers are a great quality product, as one would expect, but they are supra-aural and don't drown out outside sound as well as the M50's--this is important because i have 2 noisy kids running around part of the time when I'm trying to work.

       "  'review': \"I previously owned a pair of V-Moda Crossfade LP headphones (arguably at the same price point as these), and a pair of Sennheiser HD 428 headphones (50% of the price).  Put simply, these ATH-M50's blow the both of them out of the water in terms of sound quality and performance.  At this price point, they seem like an excellent buy, even though it's double the price of the HD428's.  I realize now that good headphones are totally worth it, and the M50's are an excellent example of that.Let's first compare with the HD 428's, for a baseline.  The HD 428's are indeed quite light and are comfortable because of this lightness.  However, they are so far behind the M50's in terms of build quality, and sound quality.  Having now listened with the M50's, the former headphones over-emphasize bass to the point where it sounded muddy.  I'm not an audiophile, so I didn't have an ear for what I should be hearing, but I could clearly tell the difference between the two.  I'll touch on the sound quality of the M50's more when I compare with the Crossfade LPs, but I want to show what one would get when one steps up to premium headphones from cheaper pairs.  Such an improvement one would get with the M50's over these specific Senns is build quality.  The audio jack and cord was extremely flimsy in the HD428's, and it indeed started to fail on me after not even 9 months of ownership.  By contrast, the M50's exhibit an attention to detail about this often-first-to-fail part of a pair of headphones.  The M50's coiled cord is probably 20x thicker and more heavy-duty than the HD428s, but the keys here are that the audio jack is metal as opposed to plastic, and the point where the jack meets the cord is encased in a metal spring.  The M50s as a result feel like an investment worth making at this price point.Moving on to the Crossfade LP phones, I'll now compare sound quality and comfort, as the Crossfade LPs seem on pair with the M50s in terms of build quality.  The M50's equalizer seems flat, not emphasizing one part of the music over another, and as a result I hear things in music I just wouldn't with the Crossfade LPs, whose equalizer I believe was bass-heavy, but don't quote me on that.  Even though I'm not an audiophile, I can STILL clearly tell the difference between these supposedly even headphones in terms of price point.  The M50s also are much more comfortable than the Crossfade LPs.  I had taken to putting microfiber cloths under the headphone pads in the latter, just to make it possible to listen for more than half an hour.  Now, with the M50s, I can wear them nonstop for hours before getting a small bit uncomfortable, which is to be expected at some point, because you are wearing something on your head.  (At that point it might be time to take a break!)  The padding on the M50s is much thicker and of much higher quality.  A plus is that because these are designed for professional mixing and such, the ear cups rotate, so regardless of the shape of your head you should be able to find an amazing fit.  (The cups on the Crossfade LPs are static in terms of rotation.)With all these positive qualities stated, I would be remiss to omit cons of the M50s.  They don't come with a sturdy carrying case (only with an admittedly sleek leather pouch), while the Crossfade LPs did arrive with a sturdy hard case.  The M50s also do not have a detachable cable, so in the unlikely event that the cable fails, or if you need to use an extremely long one for some reason, you're stuck.  The Crossfade LPs did have a detachable cable.  Something to note, though, is that there exists a straight-cable version of the M50s, which extends significantly longer, though whether it's long enough is for you to decide.  They also do not actively cancel noise, but I've found that the passive noise isolation from the cups works extremely well.  I take good care of my headphones, so I'm not worried about the cord failing, nor do I need more than 4 feet of cord, and I will as well probably purchase a case to protect my investment, but these are indeed things to note.If you don't mind purchasing a case if you're paranoid about your new amazing expensive headphones, BUY THESE!  If you need a longer cord than the coiled cord is, BUY THE STRAIGHT-CABLE VERSION OF THESE!  They are superior than everything I've used, and are the #2 headphones reviewed on [...] , but at 2/5 of the price of the #1 pair.  Win for everyone!\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"I am not one to give bad ratings first of all. In summary I expected this item to be as the reviews described it. I have been in music for years and am very picky when it comes to headphones as I rely on them as my first line when I hear a song or a beat. These aren't horrible, but you can go to Walmart and spend $40.00 to get the same if not better quality. I will list the pro's and con's. I will say that I listen to pop, country, classic rock, rock, and just about every kind of music. I admit to really like a good &#34;boom&#34; when it comes to base. My partner loved these. I think that it depends on what you want out of your experience. If you want to really hear the base and feel the song, this isn't for you. If you aren't much of a bass fan or don't like heavy bass, these are for you. I will admit bass drowns out music from time to time, but I just don't feel that these even stood up to Beats Solo's.These headphones were compared with Beats Solo's that are a year or two old.Pro's -Price for &#34;studio&#34; head phones.Long cord that appears as if it would last for a good amount of time.Clear sound.Comfortable to wear.They fold up, which makes it nice vs. the beats.Sturdy build. I feel like these will take a good beating and the cord is meant to last vs. the Monster Beats cord which does not last very long.Cons -Although the sound is clear, it almost has too much treble. I even tried it on songs with heavy bass, but it just took away from the song in my opinion.Low bass. I'm talking about bass in general. I even tested them on songs that were mean't to have steady bass and it just didn't pick it up well. Even maxed out on volume, you don't get the bass that was intended (my opinion of course).I will say that the price can be a con, just because it can trick you if you read the reviews. These ARE NOT comparable to Beats. I realize by reading reviews that some people don't like beats because of the heavy base, so I have come to the conclusion that it depends on your bass preference. If you want a more clear sounds (you like a good treble) then these work for you. IF YOU LIKE A GOOD HIT OR BASS IN YOUR MUSIC, THESE WILL NOT SATISFY YOU.In the end I will go with 3 stars because it is a good product if that's what your looking for. The main thing is to understand what you want. These are great for people who tend to feel like bass is too much on headphones such as Beats, but if you love Beats I don't think you will like these.If you have Beats Solo or better, I think this is the wrong product for you. If you DON'T LIKE BEATS, you may really like these.I am returning them because I feel that my money could be better spent on some headphones that better suited my needs.\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"So here's the deal, when I was doing my research before buying the ATH-M50s I saw a lot of reviews comparing them to the Beats by Dre, but not many (or any) comparing them to the Sennheiser HD-280s. Since I can't be the only one that wanted to see a comparison of the two before purchasing I decided to write a review doing just that. The HD-280s were my primary headphones for about 5 years before I bought the ATH-M50s about a month and a half ago.OK. So first things first. Do these sound better than the HD-280s? Unequivocally the answer to that question is yes. On every front the ATH-M50s sound better. This is most noticeable in terms of the bass, which the HD-280s are noticeably lacking. I've always felt like that the HD-280s have great mids and highs that are similarly good, although they can sometimes sound a bit shrill to some. The ATH-M50s are just slightly better on these counts, but with the added bass (which is nice and deep, but not overly thumpy like the V-Moda Crossfade LPs) the whole sound package is just a level above the HD-280s. Also, the soundstage is noticeably wider in the ATH-M50s, which is certainly welcome and sounds great.Moving beyond the sound, the ATH-M50s are decent at blocking out ambient noise, but the Sennheisers are significantly better on this count, so if that's a big consideration for you just be aware of it. I think both are pretty comfortable, with the ATH-M50s maybe have a slight edge in this category. Both fully cover the ears, but the Sennheisers somehow give the impression of creating a solid seal to the head. Overall, comfort wise I would say I like the ATH-M50s a little bit better, but its mostly a wash here. I do think the ATH-M50s look a little bit snazzier if that's important to you.In the final analysis the ATH-M50s do almost everything better than the Sennheisers, except block ambient noise. Don't get me wrong, I loved the Sennheisers and I have no regrets that I kept them as my primary headphones for such a long time, however, all things being equal I would recommend the ATH-M50s. Its the additional bass and the wider soundstage that really make me lean that way pretty significantly.I hope this helps anyone that is trying to decide between the two, and happy listening!\"},\n",

They may sound impressive in the store but mark my words, you will get tired of the constant booming and want something more neutral! Skip that learning curve and get these. Your ears will thank you.\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"To be blunt, this is the best headphone purchase I've ever made for the price (or any price). I've tried many different types of earphones and headphones, and these blow them all away (Beats, Klipsch, Etymotic, Altec Lansing, and more). The sounds is clear, natural, and uncolored (unlike the bloated bass of other brands). These are extremely comfortable; like two pillows resting on your head. They do an great job of isolating external noise, so I use them daily at work when I need to escape from office noise. They also fold up compact, and come with a handy carrying case.The cable is quite long, so for easy cable management, I recommend using a velco strap, or hook and loop cable ties from Monoprice which are sold here on Amazon.I noticed these being used in the recording studio segment on the season finale of The Voice, though they had black tape over the emblem. It's nice to know professionals use these as well.One word of caution, if you have a smartphone case that only leaves a small hole for your headphone plug, you might need an adapter, as the plug on ATH-M50 has a large base, about twice the size of the plug's base from a typical iPhone earphone.\"},\n",

       "  'review': 'If you are looking at this review most likely you have done a ton of research already so I am not going to waste both of our time.The first thing you will realize is that these headphones are really sturdy; you can feel the legit tough metal pieces that the headphone is made of; even the actual jack and screw on jack are crazy detailed. These headphones sound amazing in every sense. The comfort is amazing; my ears rest perfectly inside the cup so I cannot hear anyone trying to talk to me even when my volume is less than half way up. The headphones sound great as is but I like plugging in my little Fiio E5 headphone amp for the bass booster and I think it makes my music sound way better.ARE YOUR PAIR LEGIT? The only way to answer for sure is opening up the case of the cups and looking at the driver; if the circuit board is fake then it will be green, if not it will be gold and with a sticker saying \"125B.\" I\\'m sure you can google this if you are paranoid about having bought a fake. I bought from DJEquipmentstore in NY and even though they aren\\'t on Audio Technica\\'s authorized sellers list I got a completely legit pair.Only thing bothering me is I don\\'t know how people have bought these headphones at around $100 bucks. I always see them around $150 and I thought I was lucky to get them at $140. In any case the headphones are worth the money completely because I think these may be the last pair of headphones I buy for myself ever.I actually got my pair today and I have them on my desk playing music so they can burn in and I can truly hear the greatness of the M50\\'s.Update 1/15/12:I no longer use an amp with these headphones because it distorts the high range.They are still amazing in every sense and are a gift that keeps on giving.'},\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ll first start by saying I\\'ve owned these headphones for a year and a half now, so I can give a fair assessment of long term quality as well as the broken-in sound of these headphones.  These headphones do well with all sorts of compression rates of music (128 kbps MP3 all the way up to FLAC lossless).  I\\'ve heard some other \"monitor\" headphones can make highly compressed music sound terrible due to excessive revealing, but these headphones are the \"little black dress\" and soft-toned lighting to make everything sound great.------Audio Quality:As far as I care, these headphones are as close to perfection as possible.  Originally I was planning on buying these and eventually buying $300 headphones, but I honestly seen no point except to maybe get a bit better earcups.  On the whole the soundstage and clarity and accuracy of musical reproduction from these headphones couldn\\'t be better.  I\\'ve been able to close my eyes and \"follow\" the music through it\\'s progression in a three dimensional way that I\\'ve never experienced before.  You\\'ll hear drums off to the side with vocals 45 degrees in front of that.  Instrumentals are layered so beautifully that you\\'ll get shivers being able to pick them all out.  Amazing.*Note - These headphones do require a period of burn-in before they will sound great.  When I tried these headphones for the first time the bass was very weak and everything sounded off.  I was expecting this, so I left them to play various \"burn-in\" material such as pink noise, white noise, blue noise, drums, and music for a few hours until everything got settled in.-Bass is extremely well represented and tight to the point it sounds like miniature sub-woofers have been fitted in these \\'phones.  On the same subject, these headphones don\\'t fake the bass like Sony headphones do to make everything sound arbitrarily boomy.  These headphones have such excellent reverberation that the bass needs no extra enhancements.  However, this means the headphones have to make a good seal around your ears or the bass dies quickly.-Mids are ever so slightly recessed from the Lows and Highs.  Since I largely listen to electronic music where vocals are secondary, this isn\\'t a problem.  However if you\\'re a Grado type person who prefers the voices to be front, center, and in your face, you won\\'t get that here.  However, these headphones still will make it sound like Celine Dion is giving you a private concert regardless of the recess.-Highs are tricky to identify quality.  To me, I hear highs as representative of clarity.  For hi-hats and the like, I expect them to sound crisp, sharp, but also subtle and accurate.  These headphones deliver.-I\\'ve also used these headphones extensively for gaming, and their soundstage and clarity make a significant difference.  I\\'ve been able to score kills that have made my victim think I was cheating, just because I could so accurately hear footsteps and other minute noises.-These headphones can get to ear-splitting volume levels.  No amp required for ipods or laptops.------Earcups / Isolation:-The earcups for these headphones do generate a very good seal around my average sized ears.  I\\'ve worn these so much that the earcups actually have indentations for the top of my ear, side of head, and earlobe.  These indentations make me love these headphones even more since they\\'re \"custom fit\".-In terms of noise reduction, these cut out about 10dB worth of noise at mid-high frequencies (technical data, and I agree from experience).  You can have a conversation with someone while wearing these, but once you start playing music through them you will find yourself shouting and unable to understand a conversation.-After a year and a half, the earcups are fairly dried out and only starting to get the most minor of cracks.  The earcups cost about $20 to replace, so I\\'m not too worried with the durability since I\\'ll probably get another year out of them.-The earcups can get a bit warm on a hot-humid summer day, but it\\'s never to the point of being uncomfortable.------Other build quality:-No problems with any of the joints, no squeaks, no cracks, no nothing.  Everything slides and collapses like new, although I don\\'t regularly fold them up.-The cord is invincible.  I\\'ve rolled over it with my chair dozens of times thinking \"one day it\\'s going to fail\", but it hasn\\'t missed a beat (no pun).  Watch out though for the spring wrapped around the cord at the plug end: one time I pulled on the spring instead of the cord to remove it from an audio source and the spring completely popped out of the plug.  I had to send the headphones in to Audio-Technica to have the entire cord replaced (which they did under warranty for free and dealing with them was great!).------Minor Quibbles:-The cord is a bit long and not detachable.  Makes portability a pain with 9 feet of cord coiled in your pocket.  Also has a tendency to twist-tangle itself which requires unplugging and straightening every week or so.-Wearing these around my neck isn\\'t as comfortable as it could be.  The joints seem a bit wide and at a slightly odd angle, so something just feels a bit wrong.-Might slip off your head if you try using one earcup instead of 2.  Because the earcups are so large (to go over your entire ear), if you try to rest one of the earcups behind your ear, it might not work so well.------Conclusion:Don\\'t waste your money on $50 \"good enough\" or $300 \"overpriced\" headphones.  These are all you need and you will not regret purchasing them.  For all the purchases I\\'ve made, these headphones are in the top 5 for least regrets.  However, shop around because authorized dealers can vary widely on the price.  You should have no problem finding these in the 95-100 range, and if you beg like I did, you can get them for a little bit lower.'},\n",

       "  'review': \"The review I am writing now is actually a revision of a previous review I wrote a couple of years ago. I have now upgraded from the ATH-M50s to a pair of Beyerdynamic DT 880s (250 ohm), which are mid-range headphones. Now that I have heard both the ATH-M50s and the DT 880s I have a different perspective on these headphones.These were being driven by a FiiO E09K desktop amp and a Creative SoundBlaster X-Fi Titanium HD DAC (Burr-Brown PCM1794).Sound:Lows - The lows on these headphones are pronounced, and perhaps a bit exaggerated. While the bass is punchy it does tend to get a little bit muddled and lost with the mids. The main reason for this is probably due to the fact that these are closed-back headphones while the DT 880s are open-back (or semi-open). Having said that, the lows here are still pretty good, much better than your standard consumer headphones (*cough* Dre Beats *cough*). This may be a pro or con to you, if you are a bass-head then these headphones will sound balanced to you, if you prefer a more detailed and neutral sound (like me) then you may find the lows a bit too exaggerated and muffled.Mids - The mids on these headphones are perhaps the most disappointing to me. While they can be somewhat detailed, too often they are muffled and overpowered by the lows. Putting on the 880s after listening to these feels like a breath of fresh air. There is little clarity to be found here and the soundstage is quite narrow because of this.Highs - This is where these headphones show that they are entry-level and not mid-range. Although the highs here are still good, they are nowhere near as detailed as something from a mid-range level, and especially cannot compete with an open/semi-open set of cans. While decent, the highs here are not the M50s strong suit and are a tad dull, sometimes even harsh. They are nowhere near as bright and detailed as the DT 880s. That being said they are still quite good for entry-level headphones.Construction:The overall construction of these headphones is quite good. Although it is mostly plastic, it feels durable, albeit a bit heavy. These cans also clamp down quite hard, but you get used to it, plus they loosen up after a while. The straight cable version has a nice, thick cable, although too long and can get annoying. The worst part about these cans is their pads, they are too heavy and make my ears very hot after extended listening. I eventually switched them out for a set of Beyerdynamic velour pads and they are much more comfortable and breathable.Overall I would give these cans 4/5. Although the soundstage is limited and they lack a certain clarity, they are still excellent beginner headphones, although I think you could find better for the price. If you don't feel like shopping around for some reason (which you really should) and just want a good all-rounder set of headphones, then you can't really go wrong with these.\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"Ok, so everyone knows that perception of sound is always going to be subjective and my review will be based on my experience to date.So, I fall into the category of not been a hardcore audiophile but someone who simply likes to have good clean sound with some 'oomph' to it. I tend to prefer music bass heavy so my tastes will cater for products which can give me that. So I am not a purist guys :)I currently own a pair of Sennheiser PX100's which I have had for a good few years and they are a great pair of headphones. Not brilliant, but great nevertheless as they are so well priced. Then I have my Monster Beats Solo inner ear buds and to me these are great and offer good mix of clarity and bass. Again, not brilliant, but works for me.Then I had an itch to take it up a level and see what else was out there to give me the ideal combination of clarity and bass. I read tons of reviews on various products and realised that I had to go and listen to the various options I had considered. Bose QC5's, B&W; P5, AKG's some of the other Monster Beats over ear headphones and the Sennheiser HD25's. Whilst all had their good and bad points, at this stage the B&W; P5's sounded the best to me, but they come at a hefty price tag.Then I saw reviews online for the Audio Technica ATHM50's and the general consensus amongst the reviewers was that they were a cracking pair of headphones offering outstanding clarity, soundstage and bass and all at a very good price. So without even having listened to these, I made an impulse purchase and went for these.So bearing in mind, with the options I considered and had heard to date, I wasn't really expecting anything mind staggering but then I donned the Audio Technica's, plugged them into my simple Macbook Pro, fired up iTunes and selected a track to play and HOLY MOTHER OF G_D, I was literally BLOWN AWAY!!! I tried different tracks, BLOWN AWAY!!!, I tried tracks which I had not listened to in years, BLOWN AWAY!!! Every track I threw at the ATHM50's resulted in...you know it...BLOWN AWAY!! sound.The sound quality is on another scale altogether. The clarity, the sound staging, the bass, everything seems to just come together perfectly with these headphones. My music, which is all bog standard iTunes tracks sound completely different to my other headphones and it's as if I am listening to a whole new set of music.I selected various tracks to listen to, from Dance/house to Rock to Pop to Classical and they handle superbly. Just to get an idea of the bass, I put on 50Cents 'Candy Shop' and the bass is so deep it makes the Monster's look like amateurs. Put on AC/DC's Thunderstruck and your head is thundering with the crisp highs and low drums coming together effortlessly. Too much to mention but for me, everything just sounded so brilliant.To say I am happy is an understatement. The sound quality of these bad boys is just superb, and I mean superb. Unlike any other headphone I myself have heard to date. The only sound that comes close IMHO is when I listened to a Naim NSAT Hi-Fi system. That's about the only comparison I can come up with at this stage.So what are the negatives...- Well, they still bleed some noise which is to be expected but nothing major.- They are on the big side but then compared to the other over-ear headphones around, they are probably on par size wise.- The cable is long which is a positive if you are at home but a niggle if you are using them on your daily commute, depending on how you tie up this cable. This is probably more of a subjective negative than anything else.- Listening through my Mac, is simply superb, but listening through iPhone4, I have to bump the volume all the way up and would probably benefit from having one of those external amps to improve the sound(my next purchase perhaps). This is not for the record an issue with the headphones. Still, the sound is again IMHO nothing short of superb.Bottom Line:At the end of the day, I just wanted a pair of headphones that sounded friggin awesome and satisfied my requirements to have good clarity and good bass and these guys have ticked the box for me in a BIG way. I could care less about their technical specifications, just whether they sound good, Yes or No and they don't sound good, they sound PHENOMENAL!!Will they suit everyone? Probably not as everyone's perception of sound is subjective, but if you like me just want good clean sound with good, deep bass that does not muddle the sound, then these are certainly for you.Given their price, I think it is madness to not have one of these on your list and if you can get down to a store to listen to them, DO IT! but bear in mind that if the device in question is not going to amplify the sound enough, you will either need to bump the volume all the way up or better yet, listen to them with an external amp attached.\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"The headphones are crazy comfy not too heavy but not light either but grip a tad too tightly. They can fold up for easy storage but I feel very afraid to do so since it feels like you're almost breaking the headphones sometimes. Sound quality is the best I've heard though I've only ever had 3 pairs of headphones, these included. The real issue is that there is no volume control on the headphones which wouldn't normally be anything but a slight inconvenience except that this means that there is constant background noise since the headphones are playing at max volume constantly. The background noise has varied depending on what sound card I use but it has always been mostly quiet. You won't hear it over your music or movie but any time there's silence it can be a bit jarring. Sending your audio source through a device that can lower the volume before it gets to your headphones (such as an external soundcard) seems to be able to remove the background noise but adjusting the volume from your computer has almost no affect. Having tried the headphones with my phone (Galaxy S4) I couldn't hear any background noise so is probably be a device to device issue.Bottom line is these are very good headphones with almost no features and probably some range of background noise that you shouldn't pay more than $200 for.

You have to understand that you'll be able to listen to the finest detail in each song. I mean I heard things I've never heard before in Radiohead songs that blew my mind. Ok enough of my babbling.The headphones feel very sturdy and give a feeling that it would take a lot of effort for them to beak. Comfortability on the head and ears almost feel like their not there. The headband has a really nice cushion and the ear cushions are soft enough and large enough to fit any range of  elephant sized ears. Oh, it also would help to say that there is no need to buy noise cancelling headphones because these already act like noise cancelling headphones - just turn the volume up! The cable itself is very thick (almost as if you were to take six earbud headphone cables and put them together). The jack at the end of the cable is very fancy and very sturdy. Overall, its got a very simple look to it, nothing too fancy, and it most certainly gets the job done.P.S. You don't need to go out buying these big brand headphones like Dre Beats or Bose when you can get an even better priced, better sound quality headphone than what those companies try to sell you and rip you off. I mean you can definitely go and buy Dre Beats and put them around your neck and not even use for their purpose and look like a complete jackass, if that's your thing (style).\"},\n",

       "  'review': 'I am very happy with these headphones, but I noticed the volume needed to be at max on my iphone and the music still was not loud enough.  This was not the case with my Philips earbuds.  They were louder.  The earbuds are ideal for commuting and the gym but I wanted something premium for at home.  These headphones produce a more well rounded warm bass, reverb and acoustics overall.  What you would expect of headphones like this.They are worth it.So to counter the volume weakness, I bought a headphone amp.  I got the FiiO E6.  What a difference.  I have listened to a LOT of different headphones and these headphones now sound the way I hoped they would.  The amp has three different eq settings  - that paired with the potential of the headphones makes them awesome.  If you really want a dynamic music experience, regardless of what headphones you have - get an amp.'},\n",

       "  'review': \"For starters, im the type of person who loves music and when listening to it, i dont want to have to worry about anything else thats going on. I just get lost in the music. These headphones allow me to do just that. The audio quality is astounding and everyday im hearing new things in songs that i hadnt previously heard before. How cliche does that sound? who cares, its true. The construction of these headphones looks great and they look like they will last me a really long time. The only con that i guess some people would have a problem with is the bulk, but they do collapse and fold in for easy portable use. They came with a little protective pouch for travel so i thought that was pretty cool. In general, if you want good sound quality in a set of headphones you have to be willing to spend a little money. These are worth every penny and i'd say that they are the same if not better quality than dr dre's beats. Ive seen a lot of reviews online about these headphones agreeing that they offer better sound quality for a fraction of the price. In the end, if you want a great sounding, durable pair of headphones that doesnt cost too much money then this is the product for you. I have them on whilst writing this. Very happy with them :)\"},\n",

First off let me just say that I am only using these headphones for personal music listening. Also let me say that I am in no way into headphones enough to know all of the technical aspects of these headphones. With that being said, these headphones are insane. I did hours and hours of reasurch before finally arriving at these. The ratings/ reviews are crazy and I feared they were being over hyped. No...they live up to the hype fully. These are truly incredible. The lows are perfect, great for heavy base music. However also great for soft music. It is not overpowering it's the perfect amount.  They mids and highs are dead on. It sounds just how you want it to, these headphones crush they beats...they are even better than Beats Pro. When people hear lots of base they assume that means they are good. This can be true but Ath-m50's are more than just great base. these headphones are unbealivible. They are also super comfortable and well made. Buy them. Now.

       "  'review': 'I bought these headphones on the recommendation of the audiophile site head-fi.org.  When purchased, they were ranked #5 on head-fi\\'s best headphones list, amidst other items for $500 or $1000+.  The ranking is well-deserved: these are easily the best I\\'ve ever owned.  The baseline used for comparison are a pair of Bose QC15\\'s (noise canceling, also over-the-ear).Pros:  First, the sound quality is unmatched.  Two things were immediately noticeable: the increased depth of sound and the incredible bass.  I would listen to familiar songs and be blown away by how much better they sounded.  For maximum listening quality, use these headphones with a dedicated amplifier.  Plugging them in to an iPod or iPhone directly will not yield maximum sound quality.Second, the headphones are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time, despite being heavy.Third, the headphones block out noise very well.  However, there is no active noise canceling.Finally, they fold into a small bundle and come with a travel bag.Cons: First, the headphones are heavy.  This may be an issue to some.Second, the cord would occasionally get tangled up in things near me.  The cord is too long for my needs.  Don\\'t attempt to go running with these headphones!Third, I couldn\\'t hear my vacuum cleaner when listening to music through them.  I had to physically feel the exhaust air blowing out to know it was on.Final thoughts: These headphones also work very well in videogames.  The supreme audio clarity helped more than I expected.  Prior to buying them I had used some Bose QC15\\'s for a long time, they were my gold standard.  The Audio-Technical ATH-M50\\'s are significantly better.Also, take a look atKoss PortaPro Headphonesfor $30.  The ATH-M50s are the \"PortaPro\\'s\" of the ~$160 price range, namely, possessing sound quality that exceeds the price of the item.'},\n",

For hundred or so dollars it's easy to question the quality of these headphones when you compare the pricing to Bose or any other high end brand.  I'm very glad I finally decided to take the chance on them.  The quality of these headphones surpass the price point by a long shot.  Personally, I like a lot of the mid's and high's, and a decent amount of low's.  The M50's do just that.  The low's aren't overpowering.  If you are looking for over flooded bass look elsewhere.  Another thing I worried about before purchasing was the &#34;clamp&#34; reviews on these concerning the comfort level.  It might just be me, but I haven't notice anything along those lines.  Do yourself a favor and just buy them.\"},\n",

I like to enjoy my music, not study it. I used the Sony XB 500 in the past and I loved them but they tended to create bass in times when there shouldn't be any. I also had another set which I got as a present ages ago, and broke it by accident after like 4 months. Both these headphones were an upgrade from using earbuds and speakers my entire life. I decided to give the m50 a try since it had lots of good reviews and I LOVE THEM. I am VERY picky so if for some reason I do not think something is worth the price, I will return it immediately. You cannot go wrong with the M50. The sound is AMAZING and FRESH for all types of music (except maybe for those with LOTS of bass like dubstep). You will listen to details that you did not before. Still, music tastes are relative, some people may like them (which apparently A LOT of people do based on different internet sources) and some may hate them. So to conclude, my advice is for you to try them if you can, but if you cannot, blind buying them would not be the worst idea, and if you do blind buy it make sure you have the option to return them in case you do not like them.I am not saying that these are the best headphones under 200 dollars (which once again a lot of people claim)since I have not tried a lot of headphones, but that I am more than satisfied and will not look any longer for a pair of headphones until I need a replacement, so I am just sharing my experience :) Definitely a GREAT purchase !!!!!\"},\n",

The ears are a little big for me, as they go down my neck a bit, but I am quite small so that's my problem. My brother is huge and he says they fit fine. I can wear these for 4 or so hours before starting to feel pain from the headband and clamp,(which is kind of hard not to have for this type of headphone). This wasn't a big issue for me because I only use them a couple of hours at a time, and I was willing to sacrifice a bit of comfort for quality, and even at that they are still pretty darn comfortable! Overall there isn't much clamp, it just builds up after uaing them for a long time. The ears themselves are comfortable (lined with a soft cushion) and provide AMAZING isolation!! These babies made the airplane drone sound like a gentle hum. The quality is superb if you're moving from Apple earbuds or Skullcandy's or beats--the beats really are bad quality for their price--anyway, music sounds clear and crisp and gives a bit of a soundstage effect. Drums can sometimes sound a little punchy, and there can be a big bass but both arent overwhelming. They are big so if portability is a must, these might not be for you, though the ears do fold over and it does come with a chic travel case...You just cant put them in your sweatshirt pocket or anything. DO NOT GET THE S CABLE IF YOU ONLY WANT TO USE THEM FOR YOUR COMPUTER/IPOD. I made that mistake and I had to get an adapter, which was only $7 from Radio Shack, but I'm not downrating the product as that mistake was my own. I don't think a headphone ampilfier is needed for these, but they do sound better after some useage.

       "  'review': \"After reading up on extensive reviews of Bose, Beats, and Sony headphones, I noticed how a lot of people kept referring to the ATH-M50's for sound quality in comparison. I'm not looking for a fashion statement, and I'm not looking on being a trendsetter when it comes to headphones. I also prefer around the ear headphones instead of in-ear types. Based on extensive positive reviews that were all consistent, I decided to take a plunge and purchase these based on sound quality and comfort. I was absolutely blown away right out of the box. It doesn't matter what style of music you listen to, these headphones are amazing. I listen mostly on an ipos and ipad, in addition to an android tablet. I listen to Sirius and Pandora, and my extensive albums on my ipod. I have been listening to the same albums for over 15 years and noticed sounds and instruments for the first time with these headphones. They really bring out every aspect of music and sound. I am excited again listening to my music collection, as I am re-discovering different things that now stand out as opposed to before. If I had to find a problem or issue with these, it would be the length of the cable that they come with. However, after a couple of days (and my newfound excitement). I have grown used to the length and now take advantage of it as I can get up from my desk and walk around without having to carry my device with me. If you are teetering on which headphones to buy, you don't have to. These are the ones. They make Beats sound like Fisher Price. They also make Bose headphones sound bad. I also have Bose headphones that I used before this, and thought they were top notch. Now I am wrong - I have a set of Bose headphones for sale.\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"VERY pleased with these headphones and I'll tell you why: They are very comfortable and if you are like me where either genetics or age dictate that you wear glasses, you already know how the bows of the glasses [distance =or= reading glasses] can become uncomfortable primarily due to the two bows going under the ear cup of the headphones and thus producing additional pressure and, worse, although much depending on the design of the ear cups, interfering with the ideal =seal= of the full ear cup! These headphones are the best yet that I've used and provide a very good seal WITH my required reading glasses at the computer screen and the ear cups are large enough for the ears [a disappointing fact I had with the Sennheiser HD 360 Pro phones where the ear cups were just too small!] and the sound quality of these new Audio-Technica ATH-M50 pro studio phones is superb!Here's a quick off the cuff test [hardly scientific but hey, it works!], put the phones on [and 'especially' if you wear glasses], seat the ear cups as best you can on your ears and according to your comfort [ditto the head band part] and then, without any audio mind you, simply take your hand with your thumb and index finger together, and slowly move up and down on the headphones cord [rub the cord with your fingers] where you should hear [if you have a good seal] a discernible rubbing sound as you do that in your LEFT ear where the cord comes out from that ear cup. Proof: Try the same thing but purposely hold the left ear cup away from your left ear and that finger rubbing sound you're making with your fingers will disappear! Try it! Crude, yes, and I agree forthwith, but it works =if only= to test for a good ear cup seal and thus, with then BOTH ears having a good seal around the ear, the best reception of music quality from lows to high, especially bass sounds and their full preservation therein along with mid and upper range treble sounds, becomes immediately apparent and this 'with' your glasses. This too, how many times have you ever purposely held the ear cups against your ears and noticed the difference in sound where a poor seal is the culprit. The seal on these phones are excellent and at least this has been my own experience with these phones. They are nor tight either although they are firm but there is a difference! Tight phones let you know about it within a half hour or so and phones should NOT feel like there is a vice around your head!OK, $120 for a set of headphones is not cheap [although there are much more expensive models, to be sure!] but if you want quality headphones, you can't expect wonders with headphones that sell for $29.95! These phones do the job and with regard to user comfort and sound quality, they deliver! Uses a coiled cord [unlike the Sennheiser HD 360 where I was rather surprised at the thinness of the wire which wasn't even coiled on the Sennheiser] but these Audio-Technica phones have a decent thickness of the connecting wire, coiled for the stretch if even needed and the usual mini 4.5mm and standard 1/4 jack screw-on. They look nice too but, more importantly, they do a good job in the wearing comfort area and the production of music with an excellent seal even with glasses. I'm well satisfied!Doc Tony\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"When most people think &#34;headphones&#34;, they think of Beats by Dre, Bose, maybe Sony, and if they've done a little digging, perhaps Sennheiser. I'm here to say the first thing you should think of is &#34;Audio Technica&#34;. These things are killer, and I've tried nearly every genre of music with them. For roughly 1/2 to 1/3 of the price of a pair of Beats, you get better audio, a much more comfortable fit, and more durability (and I have tried multiple price levels of Beats so I know this for a fact). If I remember correctly to when I tried a pair of Bose top-of-the-line noise canceling headphones (at twice the price), they have better sound than those as well.First, they are virtually indestructible. Most of the major components are metal, and the parts that aren't are heavy, heavy-duty plastic. I've put them into my backpack, had them get crushed by books and my laptop, and they're still fine. The cord also follows this trend of indestructibility - I have closed it in a minivan door twice (don't even ask how) and it still works fine with no tears or even bending. To continue on the theme of the cord: It's impossible to get it tangled, the coiled part stretches nicely and doesn't distort or attempt to undo itself, and the cord only goes to one ear, which is great if you hate cords going to both ears (I do, it's annoying and gets tangled easily). The headphone jack is built like a tank and is all-metal, which is great. It also comes with a studio jack adapter for if you actually use these for a studio set (which you very well could, I just don't).Second, they are supremely comfortable - the headband adjusts for even the largest head, and the top band is covered in some very soft foam. The earcups also create a great seal to keep in the sound you want, and keep out the background noise (better than some noise-canceling headphones I've used; I've worn them on subway trains and I can barely hear a thing with a sufficiently loud song), and keep your head from feeling uncompressed. You can literally forget you're wearing these. They're also pretty easy to take off and wear around your neck if you need to, which is nice, or you can fold them up and put them in the bag (included) and they don't take up too much space.Third - the sound. I can't describe the sound. When I first got them, it was really good, but after some burning in from repeated listening, the sound is incredible and beats every set of headphones I've ever listened to, including some much more expensive ones. The bass will be clear, crisp, and deep as they need to go. If you turn them up a bit, you can feel your head shaking from what are essentially subwoofers pressed to your ears. The higher instruments and vocals don't get buried in the base, though (which is something I've noticed with Beats) and every single echo, every single guitar reverb, every single (fill in the blank with whatever you can think of) will be heard. I even listen to J-Pop on these, and some of those female singers have ridiculously high voices, and it has no trouble covering their highs without any sign of distortion at all. Classical music sounds great, too; you can notice so much more nuance and detail in the sound with these. The only BAD thing about the audio is that if you have older song tracks that are lower quality, you will definitely notice the difference; it's like the difference between the sound of a Ferrari and the sound of a go-kart.Basically, any time anyone asks me for headphone recommendations, I direct them here. There is no need for anything more expensive, and if you want to spend less, these will last way longer and sound 5 times better than anything you can get for less, so they're worth buying for pretty much anyone who likes music and wants to hear it as it was meant to be listened to.\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"I bought these after a long strong of headsets that were just plain disappointing. A friend told me about Audio Technica and swore by their quality, so I decided to give it a try.The earcups are a little tighter than on my last pair, but I'm used to it now. The sound that comes through it louder than on any other pair of headphones I've owned. It's so loud and clear sometimes that I need to turn the sound down on some programs or music files. I used to have trouble with headphone cords tangling up all the time, and it drove me nuts when I'd try to untangle them and just have them twist up on itself again. I tried all kinds of wires from clip-downs to braided wires and nothing would live up to it's promise. The cord on the ATH-M50 is thick and coiled in the middle so tangling is never an issue. All in all, I was very satisfied with my purchase.Pros:*Excellent sound quality.*Sturdy frame that folds up if needed.*Comfortable fit.Cons:*The wire, although very thick and sturdy, is a little short. Consider buying an extender or moving closer to your computer.*If you intend to use these to replace a headset, you will need to buy a standalone microphone. It does not come with one.\"},\n",

Accurate bass, mid-range and treble, definitely audiophile quality.  Soundstage is appropriate for the type of headphone it is, not sure why others complain about it in older reviews.I have them connected to my A/V receiver; the coiled cable length can be a problem, since it is short and it tends to pull down on your head making it uncomfortable; however, I have fixed this issue by adding a cable extension to it.  The advantage of a coiled cable is that it will be easier to use with a portable device rather than the very long straight cable.

From pc games, ipods, mp3\\'s to Blu-Ray and CD/DVD/HD audio. I spent a couple weeks web researching the current offerings out there. In the end touring the area to hear them all. I had no preconceived notions about saving dough and was ready to happily spend $350.00 on the \"right units\". I tried some much more expensive units and some less expensive as well.

I had a few friends try them out too during a movie or something and they said it was very comfortable at first but then began to irritate their ears. The second thing is the wire. It's way to long. I only opened up a quarter of it and tied up the rest and even that was a bit much! I guess it's because they're made for studio use.

It delivers what it advertises - True flat sound straight from the studio2. performs at all levels... tried with Fiio E6 which enhances the bass quite sumptuously3. Burn in improves the quality of the overall sound a lot4. It sounds a lot better with a soundcard than a mobile.5. If you are used to the QC's or the Beats, it will take a bit of time to get used to the pure sound. It will change your music listening experience for good.What could be better:1. Could be more portable. Tried it on the move once and it was quite difficult esp without the play/pause options on the wire. But the heck, it is not meant for it. These are studio monitors.2. Detachable cable, may be?3. Very bulky and a tad heavy.  Once you get used to it, you feel it less.4. Better casing than the rexin pouch5.

       "  'review': \"After my Bose Around-Ear headphones failed to last even three years before falling apart, I suddenly found myself in the market for a new set of headphones. Unlike when I purchased the Bose set, I decided to actually do a little research this time before taking the plunge on a pricey pair of headphones. It doesn't take long to realize that the general consensus across the internet is extremely clear: the Audio-Technica ATH-M50 is the pair to get.As it turns out, the consensus is totally right. You don't need to be a music producer or seasoned audiophile to realize that these are a fantastic set of headphones. I couldn't be described as either of the above, but I do love my music, and it has never sounded better than through these headphones. I won't embarass myself trying to use audiophile jargon that I don't understand, but I will say that the mids, treble, and bass are extraordinarily well-balanced, the sound is crystal clear, and whatever music you pump through them is reproduced with amazing accuracy.Besides the sound itself, another reason I love these headphones is their superb design. Though some have complained of the headphones being uncomfortable or causing their ears to overheat, I've experienced none of these problems. For me at least, the headphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods, thanks to the plush cushioning on the earcups and headband. Unlike the Bose, which felt incredibly flimsy, especially considering their $150 price tag, these things are built for the long haul. I love the rugged, industrial styling and the sleek black and silver color scheme, not to mention the fact swiveling ear cups that can fold up for compact storage. I even love the coiled cable and sturdy plug, which all but guarantee the tip will not fray or detach with use-- a problem I faced with, you guessed it, the Bose.There's really not much more I can say that hasn't been said in the other hundreds upon hundreds of reviews out there for these headphones. Basically, if you're in the market for a high-quality, well-built headphones in this price range, you can't do much better than these.\"},\n",

But before I get into any sort of detail of my personal experience, I should clarify this for people:THIS IS BY FAR NOT MEANT FOR CASUAL LISTENING.that being said, this doesn't mean you can't wear it and listen to it casually, I do this. However, these headphones are designed to monitor, as in give as accurate of a sound quality as possible so the person recording the music can see how good they sound. These pick up the little dings in my guitar when I hook them up.So for CASUAL listeners:These are great quality, good sound, bass is really good on the songs, however, you might have to drive up the sound a bit higher. However, I would suggest that if you want to just listen to music, go for the M30-M40 as they are cheaper, if you want a long lasting, durable, good sound then these are perfect, but I wouldn't pay the full $150 for them if you are looking for casual listening, if you find used for 80-100 then it's worth it.For Recording:I find these to be excellent. Of course I am new to the whole monitoring scene, but my previous monitoring headphones, namely my fender one that fender gave me with my guitar were great, but now that I use this I feel awful about my guitar playing, because I can hear the little dings from switching chords, or even a resistor going back in my amp...... Recorders, I can say if you're starting or even if you're dipped into that field for a while, these are a steal for the price and very portable!\"},\n",

I'm no audiophile, just a normal guy looking for some high quality headphones, but I've used a lot of headphones and I have to say, these are the best sounding headphones I've ever used. I can't even imagine how they would sound once they've gone through the recommended burn-in period.The only problem I encountered was the fit. These headphones are really tight, a problem that is ultimately my fault for not doing enough research. I didn't want to do any modifications to the headphones as many forum threads have suggested, just because I was afraid of breaking them or possibly voiding manufacturer's warranty. The fit hurt the top of my head, my ears, and the top part of my jaw bone. I let my brother and my mom try them on, and they both said the same thing. So my advice to anyone looking to purchase these headphones is to find someone who has them and wear them for about half an hour. If you're comfortable with the headphones, then by all means, buy them. You won't regret it.\"},\n",

Reading the reviews before purchasing, I expected:- Uncomfortable head band would dig into my skull- Over ear muffs would cause me heat exhaustion- Sound quality would be nothing short of amazing, I would start to hear every background instrument in every song I never even knew existedI\\'m relieved to say that they\\'re comfortable. I have a fairly large skull and am most comfortable with the headband adjusted to about half its maximum size. If you have a very small head, or a very long and pointy one, I\\'d try on a pair first before buying them.As for the heating of the ears. Beware, they do keep your ears quite warm. Living in Canada, this is good for me. I wore my new headphones while riding my polar bear yesterday, and it kept my ears warmer than a box of Timbits. So if you don\\'t live in an igloo, or live in a place where you wear shorts more than sweaters, you may be in for a rough time. Extended listening sessions will get pretty toasty.As for sound quality, I was a little disappointed. I had heard nothing but amazing reviews about the sound. When I first plugged in my headphones, I got ready for a mind blowing experience. I told my roommates to keep an eye on me from time to time, because I was about to embark on a trip like no other. When I finally hit play, I didn\\'t have any out of body experiences, nor did I feel like I was soaring across the universe. I mean, it sounded good, but not orders of magnitude better than my regular headphones (7 year old pair of Sennheiser CX-300s).In summary, they\\'re a solid pair of headphones, and I do love them. But don\\'t expect the sound to rock your socks off (unless you\\'ve using a pair of \"Beats by Dre\" or those little white earbuds that came with your iPod).

These are permanent stores with fixed prices, not auctions, so hopefully you could find them for a similar price.  But anyways...I spent almost a month looking for the \"right\" pair of headphones for my home mixing.  A month is probably a long time to spend when you aren\\'t planning on spending more than $100 anyways, maybe $150 tops, but it gives me a warm fuzzy feeling inside to know that my money has been well spent.  And it certainly has been!I must have read a thousand user reviews of different headphones, and those from audio sites like Headroom, [...] and pro-oriented sites like MusiciansFriend.  I tried out most of the more well-known headphones in this range, including Sony MDR-V6 and MDR-7506, V700DJ, Sennheiser HD280, HD485, HD515, HD595, Bose Quietcomfort 3, \"over-ear\" headphones, AKG K240, Grado SR80i and SR125, as well as the Audio-Technica AD700, A700 and m40fs.  It took a pretty damn long time.Okay, I\\'ll willingly say that between so many different headphones it\\'s hard to say what \"best\" really means.  Some headphones definitely have a \"flavor\" that people prefer but which might be annoying or distracting to others.  Since I was looking for monitor headphones, I wanted a very flat response and I personally prefer a little passive isolation (i.e. closed-back phones).  Also, my head is somewhat larger than average, and the Sennheisers and Grados were uncomfortably tight.  Even the M50s were snug at first, but of the ones I tested they have one of the nicest, sturdiest-looking bands so I wasn\\'t afraid to stretch it over my computer case overnight.  I\\'d heard that the Audiophile phones of the AT line (the AD700s and A700s) were a little big, and true to that statement they fit beautifully and the \"wings\" floated nearly weightlessly on my head.  However, they were a little more \"flavored\" than a truly flat response (they are, after all, marketed as audiophile headphones, not monitor) and I couldn\\'t find them for under $100 so that ruled them out.  Ironically, at the time of this writing Amazon apparently has them on sale for $87 with free shipping.  Huh.To say a few brief things about the other pairs I tried, the Sony\\'s and the AKG\\'s were disappointing considering all the good things I\\'d heard about them - it leads me to suspect that some of their acclaim is due to the respected status of their \"classic\" predecessors, rather than wholly based on the product itself.  That\\'s just my impression.  The m40fs was very good, the m50s were just slightly better and in my budget.  The Sennheiser 485\\'s were honestly terrific, they were the only Sennheisers that didn\\'t hurt my head and they had a very impressive sound, which I in some ways preferred to the venerable HD280s.  Still, they were open-backed and still just not quite as great as the M50s.  Bose comfort was great but after listening to all of the above their sound quality was a joke.  Then again they\\'re not exactly marketed to the professional audio crowd, that I\\'ve seen.In either case, I was VERY impressed with the sound quality of the M50s, especially the bass.  As other reviewers have said, the bass is exceptionally clear and \"punchy\", present without being overemphasized.  This is extremely ideal for monitoring, NONE of the other headphones I listened to were as faithful.  The ranges maybe ~2 octaves above middle C and higher (I\\'m a piano player so that\\'s what I think in terms of) are just a very miniscule touch bright, but then again I only have ~5 hours of burn-in as of this writing and I\\'ve heard that changes.There are a couple of significant differences between closed and open-back headphones, which is why I called this review \"best closed-back headphones under $100\".  But that\\'s exactly what they are.  Sound clarity and separation, stage and retrieval are *at least* equal to headphones two or three times this price.  A friend of mine who runs sound tech and owns a pair of A900s visited me the other day and was so impressed by the quality of these phones vs. the price he went out to buy a pair himself.  I\\'d recommend that anyone looking for a great pair of phones go and do the same!'},\n",

       "  'review': \"I bought these as my first pair of high-dollar anything for production purposes. I did quite a bit of research for the 100-150$ range and these popped up quite a bit.Build Quality:These bad boys look nice and they are built quite well. I'm not afraid of them breaking at all and I'm sure they could take drops, accidental hits, etc. They're a tad uncomfortable at first (I have a larger head, so that could explain it partly) but the material on the pads is very, very nice and stays quite comfortable for longer periods of wearing. The only problem with these to be mentioned is that the pads do press and hold as they should, making it easy to retain sweat, but it's nothing very concerning.Sound:Sounded a tiny bit scratchy at first, which is typical pre 'burn-in.' As for the sound of these things... amazing to say the least. The sound stage is absolutely amazing, and they are amazingly defined. The only thing I have to complain is that the low end is too lacking /for my tastes/ as I produce a lot of electronic music in which bass is essential. It is quite difficult to make out the sub-bass, but it's there. With (VERY!) careful EQ'ing this could be compensated for. Granted, these things are relatively flat-response. I let a few fellow audiophiles test drive them and they noted as I did, the bass response also does seem a bit resonant for some reason. It could be due to the fact they're closed, which would make sense. Interestingly enough when listening /only/ to a sine wave played at low freq's, the note being played becomes much more audible without need for adjustment. Overall, my guess is the power needed to drive these things can make frequencies below about 45hz sag quite a bit in a mix. Unfortunately I don't know what happened to my headphone preamp so I have been without it for a while.Bottom Line:Worth the money. They sound absolutely terriffic. I actually also greatly enjoy listening to my collection now on these.\"},\n",

I like it that it goes around my ears (circumaural), I can have them on for ours without even noticing, no discomfort around the ears or the top of my head.- The cable on only one side, it's cleaner and less prone to tangling.- The long cable that can reach the back of computers and lets me stand or move a bit away from my desk if I need to reach for something.- The audio jack feels sturdy and it's made to prevent the first inch of wire from bending too much right out of the plug.- They are foldable and come with a pouch.Things I don't like:- Having to roll up the extra cable and put in in my pocket if I use it to commute, Most headphones of this type have a long cable, so this is minor. Maybe the coiled cable version is better for commuters.- If I look down and shake my head they start to fall off slightly, but my head is small and narrow.

As I noted, in my title, if you can afford them, just buy 'em. I wouldn't even bother looking elsewhere.Boring stuff...I am doing a rather unfair comparison using Sennheiser HD 600's to compare these can's with. The 600's are open-dynamic, and these are closed-back so they are going to produce different sounds, even if all the components were otherwise exactly the same. But, those are my main headphones, so they are what I am most familiar with.  Also, the 600s have a 300 ohm impedance level, and the M50s have a 38 ohm impedance - the 600s pretty much NEED an amp to really drive them appropriately. Lastly, the 600s are $500, and these are $200 retail, which are generally sold about $150, but Amazon has some incredible prices (like now they are only $102) occasionallyI have only had the ATH-M50 for a few hours, getting them in a used/like new deal from Amazon (although right now the new ones are only a couple dollars more) - so these are likely going to require a bit of burn in.Testing Sources - iphone 4, Macbook Pro with digital music on internal hard drive, CD's using a Samsung Blu-ray- ported through the MacBook. iTunes used for the UI. Digitalized music is either MP3s from CD to 192 - 320 kpbs, or AAC at 192 kpbs VBR.  Testing done without any external amplification, although in a couple days I will have a small, portable amp, and will post some more impressions at that time.Music I listen to - jazz, bluegrass, classical, rock, spiritual, country, soul, R&B.;  I am a bassist, so that biases my listening somewhat.  I have found that a good female vocalist, with a quality live recording to be some of the best listening material to judge sound equipment - my reasoning? Females generally seem to have much more complex vocals than males, with a lot of overtones, and they have a wider range to see how their vocal quality changes from mid-range to highs. Live is never as good as studio, but if there is a good recording engineer, and you have quality equipment, it can sound pretty damn near like you are there so a favorite recording is Alison Krauss and Union Station - Live. Because I am away from home for a long time, the only 2 CDs I have with me are Rascal Flatts Greatest Hits LE, and The Goat Rodeo Sessions for listening.  I listened to a number of rock songs, ballads, some Satriani, Steve Vai, Earl Klugh,  Eva Cassidy (Songbird -makes me cry every time every time I hear her),  Etta James,  Michael McDonald (he's a singing fool), Dave Koz, Wynton Marsalis, Various orchestral pieces, Acoustic Alchemy, Fourplay. Also, some Stevie Wonder - who probably does some of the most complex vocals any male I can ever remember... So why does all this matter? Because sound is a very personal experience, and if you know what the person listens to, you can decide if they have somewhat similar taste in music, and that can help influence your decision.As a bass player, the spaces in music are very important to me - if bass is muddy, the spaces are filled, so a tight, crisp bass is imperative to me. Percussion needs to also be crisp with the bass drum being almost more felt than heard. Again, the space is important.So - the 600's have a much more open soundstage, and everything is just tighter. Bass is underwhelming (but as I noted, these have to be amplified).  The M50s sound fantastic however. Being closed-back, you are immediately cut off from the outside world, and the music just flows in. Bass is phenomenal - you'll hear overtones (that bassists hear, but the rest of world misses out on) with these cans that are generally totally absent except for live performances. The spacing is not as tight as the 600's, but I think with some amplification, they might be right there as well - I'll report back in a few days...The mids and highs rival the 600s and my only complaint is the soundstage is just not quite as open. Although Wynton Marsalis sounded great, overall, the classical music wasn't there. It might be the recordings, but the separation was not on par with the HD 600's... All other genre's mentioned did a phenomenal job, but for whatever reason, it wasn't happening with the classical music.So, why did I get these things when I have $500 cans? Because I can't use the 600s portably - they need to be amplified (and my amp is at home), they are not travel friendly, and I have to treat them like the expensive piece of equipment they are. I wanted some phones that I could listen to on the plane, lounging around at home, walking around outside with my portable music, etc...  I did not want to sacrifice quality, and with all the many years of positive reviews on the M50's decided the price was too good to pass up - I should have got them a long time ago. These are an easy highly recommended purchase at twice the price.  For purely classical lovers, I wasn't getting it, but everything else was great. I have found my new travelling / casual use cans.  With their low impedance they can be used with almost any music source and sound great.  I'm happy to respond to comments should anyone have them.For people that like boomy or over-powered bass you won't like these  - bass is tight, crisp, and controlled - as it's meant to be ;-)\"},\n",

While I'm no audiophile, I think the sound is absolutely incredible. These sound like a million bucks, and yet I bought them for only $110! I hear details in my music that I wouldn't otherwise. One of my other needs was noise isolation, and these do a very good job in that area. I can listen to them on a bus at less than half volume and still be able to hear perfectly. The ATH-M50s is also very comfortable, although I do need to lift up the ear cups once in a while when I am listening for a sustained period of time. The long cord is only a minor annoyance to me. Beats by Dre can't hold a candle to these babies. Look no further for the perfect headphones.\"},\n",

Having said that, I feel that I want the best sound quality possible when I listen to music or even watch movies. These deliver. I could compare these to Beats by Dre but I have only heard a pair of refurbished Beats and I suspect that they weren\\'t restored to their full potential. The mids and highs seemed to blend together, and to a degree the bass was just too hard. Even refurbished, those cost a friend of mine 180$. These, at a brand new price of 160$, delivered far more than the Beats even hoped to.The sound quality is top notch, and I only received them today (they haven\\'t had a chance to burn in). The bass is less than Beats, but the don\\'t require a battery like the mini-subs in Beats do and I\\'m positive with a burn in period they will sound far better. Mids and highs hit great and I have even found myself noticing more to my favorite songs than I would have with my previous (albeit low priced) headphones.They look good, though not as flashy as Beats, they still have a nice style to them.They are comfortable. There may be an issue for very long periods of listening with the headband putting pressure on your head but they have padded the headband so its relatively comfortable. You are still aware of it being there though. I haven\\'t noticed any pressure points around the jaw or anything as I have had experience with other over-ear headphones putting pressure there. The cups around the ears are soft and comfortable.These headphones can fold up and come with a \"leather-ish\" bag, but it is a soft case and for traveling I would recommend getting a hard case of some sort to not risk damaging these in transit.Overall, these are the best headphones I have ever owned and I definitely do not regret buying these. Worth every penny if you love great sound like it do.'},\n",

Like I've read, the mids are maybe a bit low, but that's easy enough to EQ, and the bass is nice and tight, while the highs are crisp and well behaved.  My only wish is that the ear well was a little deeper, as my ear hits the fabric which makes it uncomfortable after a while.

The headphones fit snuggly (how they should in my opinion) I had some big Sony headphones that flopped off with every head turn which is annoying as hell. I guess it makes like me the fit more than others. With that said I wouldnt recommend stretching them out. I like my headphones feeling new every time I put em on.Sound Quality: 5/5 - You\\'ve read the reviews so I\\'m not going to waste time telling how good they are. Instead! I recently discovered they sound waaaaay better when you adjust your PC volume controls to the following: Volume Control > Playback > Headphone Properties > Advanced > 2 channel, 24 bit, 96000 Hz (Studio Quality). I dont care to know why it does sound better with these options! Im not an expert in audio engineering. I just know what sounds good. Try it if it isn\\'t your default already. Also 320 bitrate files now play a factor. You can tell the difference between 192kbs audio files. So start \"buying\" higher quality music while you wait for these things to hit your door.Appearance/Construction: Solid material! Nothing flimsy or cheap about it. You get it how it is in the commerical.Thats my short review. No point in getting all technical. They sound good. Buy em. And btw I had the Beats before which I sold to someone. Battery life is horrible (3-4 days max). And people are right, I can understand the muffled muddy exaggerated bass after listening to these.I got mine two days ago so I\\'m still doing the burn thing I keep reading about I\\'ll keep you guys posted if I notice a change after 100+ hours.Update: I forgot to mention to turn the Headphone Virtilization on under Enhancements.

The one who didn't expected these to be noise cancelling... which of course they are not, nor are they advertised to be. They are, however, advertised to be extremely accurate sounding headphones, which they are. They sound absolutely great. The build quality is excellent, they are comfortable for their size, and most importantly they sound fantastic. Out of the box they didn't sound great, they in fact sounded very mediocre. I almost felt like I wasted money, but after a week or two of burning them in, the true clarity most definitely came out.There are small programs out there that can run white noise / pink noise / frequency sweeps and I definitely recommend them to burn these headphones in. Pink noise is supposed to be pretty good for burn in, or so I've heard. Or you could just keep a wide variety of music playing. I highly suggest not rating these headphones until a week or two of burning in, and only then can you conclude on the quality of sound.These headphones isolate sound very well. Let me clarify here, they certainly are not noise cancelling. You can hear outside noises to a certain extent, people talking, etc can be heard if they're nearby unless you have the volume at a decent level, then you really can't hear much anything. They keep sound in pretty damn good. I can listen to these in a quiet study lounge with a pleasantly loud voice without fear of distracting those around me. Sometimes I truly wonder if all this sound going into my ear is completely inaudible to those around me, and I take the headphones and realize that they really do prevent a good amount of sound leakage. You can't crank it up insanely loud and expect no leakage, you have to be somewhat realistic here, but they're the best I've seen at that.I'm no audiophile, but I like to enjoy the luxury of detailed, realistic sound and these headphones deliver. The bass is not overwhelming or in excess, it's just right. These 'phones do not amplify the bass more than what should be there, nor they hide or muffle it. It's clear, concise, punchy, and certainly satisfactory.I got these headphones brand spanking new in the box in perfect condition on eBay by a certified audio-technica dealer. They are at a buy it now price of $105, but it gives you the option to make an offer. Needless to say I payed much less than the prices I found on the web, and perhaps you would consider the route I took.\"},\n",

The connection between the cord and the headphone seems sturdy.  The jack has a plug that can screw on and off for portable players and use with a receiver.  I also like that the the jack has a spring around the cable to minimize wear and tear.  The other thing about the build that I love is how the cups fold.  When you take them off your head and put them around your neck, you can fold them sideways.  A very good thing if you walk around with them all day like I do.Comfort: They aren't the most comfortable in the whole world, but definitely not terrible.  I've worn them for hours without significant discomfort.  The one thing I could see being an issue is if you have large ears.  Mine are average size I would say and almost completely fill up the cups.Sound Quality: I absolutely love the sound quality of these head phones. I listen to everything except country, ska, and pop music and I haven't found a weak spot yet.  I've listened to the lineup of AKG, Grado, and sennheiser.  I chose these because in my opinion they do a better job across genres.  If you want more info on sound, go to head-fi.org.  They have numerous reviews and discussions.Headphone Amp or DAC necessary?  The first thing you should be aware of is that these headphones WILL NOT live up to their potential if you play them through an ipod. This is more of a product of how bad the ipod amp/dac really is and not really a comment on the headphones.  If you use an Ipod it will be essential that you use an amp and dac.  Anyway, I play them through my Droid X using a player with an EQ and they sound very good.  Playing them through my Headroom Total Airhead the lows sound better, clarity is improved, and soundstage is marginally better.  I would say the amp adds about 10-20% sound quality while played through my phone.  Played through my Marantz SA8003, they sound even better.\"},\n",

That combination makes for a fatally tiring listening experience. The pads are pleather and terribly uncomfortable, whilst having an almost starchy texture to them. The headband clamps onto larger heads and lacks decent padding underneath. These phones are also terrible in regards to any soundstage at all, which means for gaming, these will be pretty terrible. Moreover their extremely aggressive presentation makes these phones just hard to listen to. They also can't do lighter genres like Jazz and Classical due to their poor positioning.

       "  'review': \"After reading a lot of reviews I decided to go with these headphones.A little about myself. I am not an audiophile. I like to sit down at my desk downstairs with my parents. When I want to work or whatever I want to do, I like to isolate my self with some music. I really dislike hearing noise when I want to do something on the computer or anything with concentration. With that in mind I first purchased a set of Bose qc15's. Previous headphones before that were some skull candy headphones which I thought were cool but made my ears hurt after extended use because the music scratched my inner ear when the music was medium volume.I want to do a comparison between these and the Bose because I am pretty sure I am not the only one that was caught in this situation. I had the Bose qc15 for about 2 days and then I returned them to best buy. I didn't return them because I disliked them. In fact I thought they were pretty good. The thing that bugged me the most was I really felt I didn't get my money's worth with 300 dollars. At best buy it was actually 370 total with warranty. A warranty is a must for an expensive pair of headphones, plus I've read Bose charges you extra for broken phones. Anyway back to the point, The Bose was really soft and comfortable, I was really impressed with the noise cancellation until. Then I thought about it, it really isn't that impressive for what your paying for at all. It goes like this, Someone is talking and you hear them well, you put the Bose headphones on they sound a little less then before, then you turn noise cancellation on and then they sound more less and distant but you could hear them clearly. When you turn on music half way they are totally gone. The sound quality was okay, it started sounding more crispier after the 1st day of use but nothing crazy. Now some people ask well if price wasn't an issue with the Bose would you get them vs the ath-m50? I would say id go with the ath-m50. The sound is much better. I will explain the quality as best as I can later. When money becomes the issue and for most of us is the deciding factor on which phones will give you the best bang for your buck. The ath-m50 definitely gives you the value for your money.Now to the Audio Technica ath-m50. I love the fact you can get headphones that are great for this price range. Some reviews complain about comfort, I really can't say that they are uncomfortable. I find these headphones to be really comfortable. The Bose would be like a 10 and these would be like an 8.5. The ear pads are not very soft but are soft on your ears that make it comfortable. I don't have that clamping problem, overall they fit very well on my head. I don't have a head shaped like a bball, it's pretty avg. As far as the sound goes, I only burned these in about 5 hours but the music isn't powerful. I didn't expect them to be punching your ears in. The bass is really good(I have an amp fiio e6). The sounds are clear and crisp. The Bose seemed to have to much bass and uncontrolled compared to these. The music flows very nicely and doesn't cause fatigue. I think I can have these on for a while without it bothering me to. I mean for the bose at best buy with warranty your paying 370. With these and an amp i paid 196 now if i had a budget of 370 again, i could also add in some sick in ear headphones or maybe the seinheisser hd-25 II(200$). These Headphones are not for portability, and I honestly don't care i do most of my listening at home, but down the road I will invest in some other portable headphones.In conclusion if you want a good pair of headphones for home use that will block out noise just as good as the Bose qc15 when the music is on, get these. The sound quality is really good, and for the price, you can't beat it.\"},\n",

The highs are tight and crisp, leaving ears tingling with anticipation for more. The mids are nice and rich, with the most detail I have ever heard. The bass is completely pumpin'. If you put your hands on the outside of these, you can feel them vibrate. As a word of warning, these leak noise quite a bit, but then again, I prefer for my music to be very loud, so if you like a quieter volume, they most likely won't leak as much. These are very comfortable headphones, and I'm listening to them now. Alright, now it's time to step on some toes. These completely surpass Beats by Dre. I have listened to the Solo HD's, and the Studio's, and these are SO much better. If you have even thought about beats, get these NOW.\"},\n",

So unless you have a big head or recieved a counterfeit...)If I had to imagine any con with these headphones: the coiled cord is maybe a little heavy if you ever go out with them?Other than that, which isn't even a big deal, I can't honestly think of anything bad about these headphones.In any case, these headphones are beautiful, comfortable, and have beautiful sound, are sturdy, and In essence: are top shelf quality.\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"I'd been looking at headphones for about a month or so looking on various headphone review sites when i finally came across the Audio-Technica ATH-M50 set. I was looking for a great pair of headphones between 150 and 300 dollars, so these were on the low end of my search, but i'm glad I made this choice. I had seen nothing but great reviews of these headphones so i decided to check them out, and now I'm adding another great review of them.I listen to all kinds of different music; rock, hip-hop, country, alternative, folk, classical, reggae, blues, jazz, techno, psychadelic anything you name I listen to it. So I didn't want a pair of headphones that could only do justice to certain kinds of music. These headphones do a great job with all these kinds of music.Bass(4 of 5)- these headphones have great bass that is  very precise and has a great punch. They are great for listening to hip hop and techno giving the songs the needed bass. The only reason i gave them a 4 is because their are headphones out there with more bass which i wasn't looking forAcoustic(5 of 5)- you can hear every minute detail of any acoustic song. You can hear each individual guitar pick and has a perfect sound for it. that being said they are not made specifically for this so there are headphones better at acoustics if that's primarily what you're looking for. (Grado Sr225i's are great)Classical(5 of 5) great for all kinds of classical music, i especially like the sound of string music with these headphones. you feel like you are at the concert.Live Music(5 of 5) live music just sounds stunning with these headphones. It feels like you're at the concert. You can hear the artist taking breaths to sing his next line.Sound Stage(4 of 5) not the best sound stage but very good considering that they are closed back headphones. They fill your whole head with music not just your ears.Comfortability(4 of 5) earpads are very nice and comfortable and fit securily over your ears. With the leather pad though it gets a little hot after long periods of time which is expected with this kind of headphone. Fits perfectly over the head, not too tight and not too loose.These headphones are overall amazing, creates a realistic sound for your music. A great buy for the price and are just as good or better than almost all headphones from 100-300 dollars. The price for these headphones alone is a great reason to buy them. One thing i will say though that if you listen to primarily one kind of music there are probably better headphones out there but those will cost much more. For someone who listens to many kinds of music and wants a great pair of headphones cheap these are perfect.Also these headphones benefit a good amount with the use of a headphone amp.\"},\n",

I got them 2 evenings ago and popped them on just for a minute to sample the sound before I burned them a bit.  Even without being burned in at all, I could tell these phones were going to be something special.  I set them up with an old iPod and fed them a mixture of white, pink, grey, and brown noise for about 14 hours.  After this initial burn, I ran them through a bass test regiment, feeding them bass waves from 5hz to 100hz in 5hz increments.  The results were impressive, the frequency response was as advertised, and no frequency produced any unwanted noise from the structure...these cans are solid.  It was time to listen to some music.  I connected the phones to my Nuforce Icon DAC / Acer C720 Chromebook and opened Google Play Music.  The Nuforce DAC is a wonderful digital-to-analog converter/headphone amp.  It has tons of power and doesn't color the sound at all.  It also works perfectly with the Chromebook when connected via USB.  The Google Play Music HTML 5 app doesn't have any EQ settings so I was not reducing or enhancing any frequencies, and all the files I played were ripped at 320kbps or higher.  I spent hours listening to different genres of music ranging from classical to thrash metal and everything in between, and I was really blown away by what I was hearing (and what I wasn't hearing).  The sound of these phones is very balanced with excellent highs, tight and accurate lows, and mids that sound incredibly natural.  The sound stage was impressive as well.  Not so narrow to make me feel like everything was happening inside my head, but not so wide that things started feeling distant or lost.  All the music played as though I had speakers with separate woofers, mid-ranges, and tweeters on my ears and no frequency range was drowning out the others.  I was listen to my music like I was a kid in a candy store; a little taste of this, a sample of that, and then grab one of these.  I spent hours and hours listening and I just didn't want to take them off.  These cans are worth every penny I spent on them.  I doubt I will every use my Sony MDR-V6s again, and I will likely only use my V-Moda Crossfade LP's when I really want to crank up the bass.  Are there better cans out there?  Yes.  In this price range?  No.  And believe me, I have tried a lot of them.\"},\n",

My first try was not very successful (See my review of Skullcandy SCS-SCBP3.5 Skullcrushers). So, I went back to the drawing board and did a lot more research. Finally decided on the Audio-Technica ATH-M50S\\'s.According to my research, these \"cans\" (like the vernacular?) require a lot of burn-in time to reach their full potential. However, I was happy with these right out of the box. I don\\'t know if this burn-in thing is true or not but the more I listen to these the happier I am with them. They get plenty loud with my iPod and if I ever want to make my ears truly bleed, I can always add a headphone amplifier.On to the attributes:Comfort - 4 (of 5) Stars. These are a big set of phones, so they can get a bit heavy on the head. The ear pads have a nice layer of foam and fit comfortably over the ears.Ease of Use - 5 Stars. How easy can it get? Put `em on your head and plug `em in. They\\'re even clearly marked for L and R.Sound Quality - 5 Stars. This is where these phones really shine. Would rate them higher if I could. Not only do they get loud without distorting, there is so much clarity in the music that it\\'s hard to describe.Construction Quality - 5 Stars. These headphones seem put together really well. They are marketed for use in an audio studio, so, perhaps that is the reason for the robust construction. For example, the connector plug is made of metal instead of plastic. Also, where the cable is attached to the connector plug is reinforced with a spring, which is a common weak point for a lot of headphones.Portability - 3 Stars. As I noted earlier, these are big phones. You would not wear them on a run or exercising. Even when folded up and packed into the included carrying bag, they take up a lot of space. But that is not what these phones are for.Overall, I have not been as happy with any other headphones I\\'ve ever owned as I am with these. However, I\\'ve never spent as much for a set of headphones either. Still, these are well worth the investment and I doubt I would be happier with headphones costing twice as much.'},\n",

       "  'review': \"I have an Amazon Prime account, but these arrived in just one day (without paying extra), not two.  I bought them to use when I'm on my whole body vibration machine, to listen to the TV, because the WBV machine is VERY loud, and to hear the TV over it without headphones, I have to raise the volume to nearly ear-splitting level.  I have better hearing than anyone I know and began to worry about damaging it, so initially, I tried using my husband's (comparatively low-tech) TV  Ears.  The static was so bad that there were times I couldn't hear what was being said on the TV, sometimes for my entire exercise session, so using them was an exercise in frustration.  It was like trying to listen to a very-poorly-tuned-in radio station.  I looked into other, much more expensive kinds of wireless headphones, but found that even with the set I was prepared to pay almost $300 for, there are often issues of static or synchronization (a delay in hearing what the people on the screen are saying), so I decided that a wired version would be better for my purposes (and stress level).  I have a stereo receiver which my TV is hooked up to for surround sound, so I just plug my Audio-Technica set into that.  I've only used them for 10 minutes at a time for three days now, but haven't had a single issue with them.  Of course there has been absolutely no static, and no delay between what I see someone saying on TV and what I hear in the headphones. They are extremely comfortable, fit well, and stay on my head while I'm shaking on my machine - WITHOUT my head feeling like it's being squeezed by them (because it's not).  They don't completely block out the noise of the machine (but they don't claim to do such, nor did I expect them to), but they DO actually dull it considerably, enough that I don't have to turn up the volume much to hear what is being said on TV.  I am thrilled with this purchase, and wish I'd done so long ago.  BTW, two days ago my teenage grandson was over and I turned on the TV to a music channel for him - not realizing that I had forgotten to unplug my headphones from the receiver.  I turned the volume up, and up some more, until we both could hear the TV well (and I sit a good 18 feet from the TV, which the headphones were near), but I couldn't understand why we weren't hearing the music in surround-sound through the speakers around the room - until I realized we were listening to the television THROUGH THE HEADPHONES which were ACROSS THE ROOM (by about a dozen and a half feet)!  We were both amazed and impressed by that.\"},\n",

I bought some $20 skullcandy uprocks and they were surprisingly terrific. I never really realized how much headphones can boost your experience so I wanted even more. After weeks and weeks of research. I was between this and Sennheiser 595 and Sennheiser 280. Sadly I couldn't listen to any of these 3 and had to make my decision off other's judgements. I ended up choosing these. I wanted headphones solely for the purpose of listening to my music with the best sound I could. I didn't really want an amp (please tell me if you think I should get one) so I could listen to them in a more simple manner. I took them straight out of the box and started listening to all kinds of hit new music that would test its capabilities. It has only been 2 days and people say you need burn in time but so far they haven't met my enormous expectations and I am sort of worried.

My dog, however thought that they were a chew toy.  Then, my wife got a free prize through work, which was a pair of hd 201s.  After a few minutes of listening to these, I know that I was going to need to spend a little more money to get the sound I wanted.  I work out a lot, so I own two pairs of earbuds, one for running and one for regular non running days.  I have klipsch s3 in ear buds for the non running days, and they are awesome for what they do, but still not enough for me.  For a while, I have been seeing the Beats headphones EVERYWHERE, and I was wondering what the fuss was all about.  At a poker game, one of my friends brought a pair of Solo Hd's with him and I finally got to try them out, and they were better than my klipsch in ear headphones, but it was almost all bass.  So much bass, in fact, that I could not hear anything else on songs that have heavy bass.  So, I started looking at reviews on headphones and decided on these.Got them for $159 (although they were down to 132 a week before, but I reviewed headphones for a month or so), shipped from amazon in two days.  For comparison, I listened to a song with the senns, then the klipsch, and then these.  NO CONTEST!  I think at one point during the first song, I took them off, found my wife and made her listen to them.  Neither one of us could believe the sound quality from these.  They were a little tight at first, but as many people have pointed out, the band is made of a metal strip and can be stretched over the box it comes in (or a tissue box) overnight to loosen them up.  I am also about halfway through the recommended 40 - hour burn in period, so I expect these to get even better.If you love only bass and wish to look cool while listening to your music, then join the herd and buy beats headphones.  If you like overall sound quality, and dont get me wrong, the bass on these headphones is still very good, you cannot go wrong with these. They are amazing.If you have gotten this far, what more do you need?  They are 4.7 out of 5 stars, and 84% of people have given this item 5 stars.

I read many reviews from users of other manufacturers and found frequent complaints about plastic headbands breaking.  The ATH-M50 uses a stainless steel rail to support the cups.  The ear cup pressure is adequate without causing discomfort after extended listening.  The cord for this model comes in a 6 ft coiled or a 12 ft straight option.  I opted for the straight cord because I don't like having the cord constantly pulling on me.  For shorter distance listening, I simply put a Velcro strap on the cord to take up the excess.  I also like the 1/8 inch plug that's screwed into the 1/4 inch plug adapter.  It gives it a clean and sturdy look.The most stunning feature of the ATH-M50  is its flat response.  This headphone does not color the material in any way.  Music is reproduced clearly and precisely.  The dynamic range is stellar and the sensitivity is most notable.After a couple weeks of generaI listening to break-in the drivers, I put these headphones to the test.  I started with a test track called 'Red hot car' from Squarepusher.  The track is very synthetic, with extreme changes in dynamics and frequencies.  The response was amazing with no distortion.  The sensitivity is the next admiral quality of these headphones.  During an HD performance of the New York Philhrmonic , I could easily and clearly hear the minute sounds of the performers shuffling and turning pages of sheet music during quiet passages.  To test vocal and DEEP bass response, I used a recording called 'River' by Natalie Merchant.  The headphones pushed my low-end hearing abilities to near sub-sonic.  Then to test overall response, I ran a dynamically scorching groove called 'Walk the Walk' by non else than the jazz group, Spyro Gyra.The Audio Technica ATH-M50 certainly proved to be the perfect asset to the audiophile's music collection and I highly recommend them.  I was extremely impressed by the quality of sound for such a fair price.  There was only one disappointing characteristic about the headphone that I should warn you of.  If you have a poorly recorded music collection and sensitive hearing, this headphone will reveal all the annoying flaws.  Some listeners may have to upgrade their music collections.\"},\n",

My musician/studio friends told me to look at either this set or the Beyerdynamic DT770. I went with these because they're cheaper, closed ear, and have better lows. Open ear is more comfortable/natural feeling I think, but these block a lot of outside noise, and you won't bother your coworkers even when they are cranked up.The build quality is exceptional and the sound is very balanced: no overpowering or muddy lows, no tinny highs. Even on a phone or other portable audio source, these cans get as loud as I can stand without distortion or the need to hook up a preamp. The headband/can housings stretch and bend every way you'd expect studio cans to, without any cheap plastic bendy feel.I think my head is fairly normal sized, but on my head they clamp down pretty tightly. Its a little uncomfortable for long sessions. The Beyerdynamic DT770 pads are more comfortable due to their open ear nature and the huge size of the pads. Putting the DT770 on is like strapping two halves of a hollow grapefruit to your head. The tradeoff is more than fair though, the lows are definitely better on these M50s.I don't ever review stuff on amazon because usually the things I buy are not exceptionally better or worse than expected. With these though, I don't think I've ever been so completely satisfied with a thing that I have purchased with dollars.

After doing a lot of research online, and doing a lot of testing and listening to headphones in stores I decided to give the ATH-M50S a try.  WOW!  These things are amazing.  You will hear things you never knew were present in your favorite songs.  The lows, mids, and highs are fantastic.  The sound is full and crystal clear!  I was able to compare these to Bose, Beats by Dre, Sony, and several other popular headphones and none fully compared.On top of the great sound the headphones feel very well made.  They come with a great carrying bag and can fold up nicely.  They are very comfortable on my head and don't have too much weight.  I've been able to wear them for 4-5 hours straight with minimal annoyance or bother.  Other headphones would last me 30 minutes to an hour before I needed to fidget with them.If you want amazing sound and quality at an insanely low price(I paid sub $100, but would have paid MUCH more) get these headphones.

       "  'review': \"Coming from constantly using $20-30 headphones, these are a significant upgrade. I think most people are going to attracted to this product because of the price and I can tell you that it doesn't disappoint. You will hear sounds that you've never even noticed in your music collection.The highs are crisp and clear. The mids and lows are strong as well. When these headphones are loud, the sound intensity does not irritate you. Most of your standard cheap headphones will cause you to grow tired of wearing them and using them at a consistently mid-high volume. The biggest difference is the base. The base resonates and reverberates after deep tones are initially struck. Cheaper headphones kind of have a kick and stop effect when beats are played. You will definitely enjoy this BIG difference.The construction is solid. It will fit any size head comfortably and folds up to be compactly carried around. There are some things to consider about features of this construction though. The line into the headphone is not removable. Also, the audio connector is 3.5mm and comes with the larger 1/4-inch adapter. The 1/4-inch adapter is a screw-on type and does not rely on spring tension to keep it attached to the 3.5mm connector. This is a nice design since the springs tend to be subject to fatigue after some time and lose their ability to hold onto the plug. Also, when the 1/4-inch adapter is on, the housing metal lines up so that you can't tell it's even an adapter! One thing I'd like to mention is that the thread quality of the screw is kind of rough. It hasn't been a problem but be careful not to forcibly cross-thread the two pieces.For the money, these headphones are second to none. There are no major problems with it and I would recommend this to anyone would enjoys music.\"},\n",

I did a lot of reading and found this set on The Wire Cutter's website ([...]).QUICK AND DIRTY REVIEW: these are THE BEST sounding headphones I've ever tried on. The pressure they put on my head was a little too much for me, and on a long flight I had to take them off a number of times to recover. If you've got a tougher head than I (which is probably true of most) then BUY THESE NOW and never look back! Many people who know much more than I do rank these up there with sets that cost >$1000.MORE DETAIL: I'm a maximizer, so I can't stand not being completely happy with my purchases. Therefore, I bought the following headphones to test them all out:Audio-Technica ATH-M50 (These ones)Sennheiser HD 380 Pro (saw a website that gave them similar ratings)Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7B (Noise Canceling)Bose Quiet Comfort 15 (Noise Canceling)First off, after just a few songs I was able to eliminate the Sennheiser HD 380 Pro set (ear pads weren't terribly comfortable with their faux leather being kind of scratchy/funny feeling) and the Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7B (the noise canceling wasn't very good and the sound quality wasn't as good as the ATH-M50 set.What it all came down to for me was comfort. I realized that the only times I'll be wearing over-ear headphones is for long stretches of time (flights, working at my computer, etc.) and if they're not super comfortable then I won't enjoy them more than a simple earbud set.When it came down to my decision, the Bose Quiet Comfort 15 set didn't sound quite as good, but still had high enough quality to live with, and the comfort was easily the best of any set I've tried. Plus the noise canceling will be awesome for flights. I'll be buying a refurbished set ($90 cheaper) and eating out a few times less to pay for the difference.For those interested, here's a list of the songs I used to test the headphones, each for their own specific reasons:Only Time - EnyaClarinet Concerto in A 2nd Movement - MozartSuite for Cello Solo No. 1 in G, prelude - BachLike a G6 - Far East MovementFirst of the Year - Equinox -- SkrillexDerezzed (Remixed by The Glitch Mob) - The Glitch Mob, Daft PunkBillie Jean - Michael JacksonSome Nights - Fun.\"},\n",

If you are into dubstep, but coming from the cheaper bass boosted headphones like I was, it may seem dissapointing at first, but looking back now. The bass is WAY better. Even better than beats. Beats have a boomy punchy bass that hurts your ears after awhile, with horrible sound quality. These underpriced beasts give the most deep warmhearting bass I had ever heard. The bass doesn't hurt but its so clear and beautiful. The low frequency will make you feel at peace and just plain out awesome. ANY genre of music is perfect with these.

       "  'review': \"I am not an audiophile, which means I can't describe the sound quality or listening experience of the ATH-M50's using technical terminology.  I can say that I am an avid and eclectic listener of music ranging from jazz to classical to world to vocals across the past 50+ years - and was a musician in my younger days.  I know and appreciate what good music sounds like, and my quest for headphones has been to find the ideal representation of what I experience in listening to a live performance in a good acoustic environment, which means i have a set of standards against which to compare various products.  I also travel frequently, so while I have not tried every headphone brand and model out there, I've worked my way pretty well down the list, from Klipsch to Sennheiser to Bose to Beats to Bowers and Wilkens to - you name it.  And I have noted those that were not for me (Beats - too much base) to those I liked (Klipsch One).  And, I have to admit that price was a factor.  Not to say I wasn't willing to pay $300+, but if I could find what I wanted for less, so much the better. After extensive reviews on Amazon and other sites in addition to my own listening experiences with various headphones, I kept coming back to the consistent superior reviews of the ATH-M50's, but  had never listened to them, so had some concerns about making the purchase.  I liked the fact that musicians and recording artists recommended their superior &#34;flat&#34; sound - no artificial tonal emphasis, just pure realistic sound.  Anyway, I had them on my wish list and when the price dropped I bought them, figuring if they turned out to be duds I could return them.  Upon receipt I did a quick listen and was very impressed, but did my due diligence and burned them in for 24 hours before really trying to judge them.  My conclusions are: they are better than any other headphones I have listened to.  There is no boomy bass, no artificial treble - just pure clear music, with every drumbeat or guitar strum clear and distinct. The sound is full and rich; close your eyes and you're listening to a live performance.  I'm 100% satisfied.  These are, in my opinion, the best headphones you can buy - not just for the money, but at any price up to the $300-400 dollar level.  There may well be, and likely are, headphones costing far more that are equal or better, but my ears cannot distinguish $600 dollars worth of difference - so I'm good with these.  They are also very comfortable - all points that touch your head are padded. The coiled cord combines length without cumbersome excessive cord to handle, and they fold nicely for travel.  Given that listening preferences are somewhat personal, and sound quality is about 80% technical and 20% personal preference, I recommend trying as many headphones as possible. But bottom line, I can highly recommend these and doubt that you will be disappointed with your purchase.\"},\n",

I mainly would put my money on quality speakers or Ipod Docks that were on the higher end. Every time I tried the Bose headphones at the Apple store or Best Buy, they just never sounded right to me, too much bass and dirty mids.This changed when I purchased a pair of Klipsch S4s for the gym.  Unfortunately they would not stay in my ears as soon as I started running.  So unintentionally I started using the S4s for around the house and using them more and more.  The only issue is that I didn't want an in-ear headphone so my search for the perfect over the ear headphone journey started.  I spent many hours at HeadFi.org reading review after review.  This M50 model is very much loved and hated over there.  I decided to make the jump when Guitar Center had the $29 Leap Year coupon so I got these for $129.I took them home and almost took them straight back.  They initially sounded very thin, no bass and a very small soundstage.  Even Deadmau5 sounded below average.  So after leaving them playing overnight, the sound improved immensely and I haven't looked back since.  Are they audiophile material, I don't think so.  But they are very detailed and balanced.  Lots of reviews say that they are too bassy and the mids are recessed.  I don't think so, if anything mine are sometimes too flat with some genres but I can live with that.  I mainly listen to indie rock, acoustic, chill, electronica and rock.  I think they perform the least with rock but they sound outstanding for electronica, dub, acoustic and chill downtempo.  Maybe I'll get some grado sr's for the rock genre since i've heard nothing but good things about them.If you want to demo these, try a glimpse of hope by Kryptic Minds to see how the bass is handled properly and is not exaggerated at all.  Are there better headphones out there than the M50s, the answer is yes but you will pay much more and the improvement will be minor.Los\"},\n",

After extensive research I decided on the ATH M50, and after a few hours of listening these were the right pick. The only negative about them is that it is a bit uncomfortable to listen to them for many hours at a time (more than 3-4 or so) but there aren't many times when that happens, so for all purposes these are fine.  Sound quality is excellent, way better than the Bose.\"},\n",

The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that these do not provide top quality audio that perhaps audiophiles demand.  In my opinion they are approximately the same as a nice pair of Koss I owned 30 years ago, and slightly better than the Aiwa I'm replacing now.  Adjusting for dollar comparisons, I think the Koss in 1980 and the ATH-M50 list price today are about the same, the difference being the great price you can actually buy them for on Amazon. I use these when on a computer, and to listen to TV...perfect for that.  They are not a replacement for my speakers on my home theater system. My wife has a pair of Bose noise canceling headphones that are excellent but cost well over twice what I paid for the ATH-M50s.\"},\n",

I even asked a question on amazon and got all responses claiming these were better than beats. So for just a little over 100 dollars I took a shot and these babies are flat out amazing. I am 32 years old and I am not some kid on here giving a review. Yeah the beats are a lot cooler looking and will give you more street cred, but if you are a mature grown up that wants the best quality audio, get these headphones. The highs mids and lows all sound fantastic with just the right amount of bass. Beats headphones are just bass heavy and do not sound as good all around. If you check the specs you will find these are better in every category except bass, where beats are 106db these are 99 db. They are not that far off, and I believe gives just the perfect amount of bass. If you are thinking about buying beats headphones, don't. Do yourself a favor and pick these up. Because this is really the way artists intended you to hear their music. Unless that is you are looking to make a 300 dollar fashion statement, if that's what you are going for, then get the beats headphones.\"},\n",

Not much difference.  However, in practice being driven by my Sony MP3 player they sound much louder.  I attribute this to the much better isolation, much better base response, and flatter overall frequency response.  For the CD280 I had to activate the MP3 player's bass boost (actually it's a non-bass attenuator) cutting overall power.

After much research I decided to jump the gun after so many recommendations on these phones.  These headphones surely do not disappoint!  As an upgrade to my Sony MDR-V700dj's of about three years, I can most definitely tell what I have been missing in my music.  The ATH-M50 is very very balanced, and for my use, is coupled with a Sony NWZ-A818 walkman unamped.  The musical range is simply fantastic, as you can really focus in on the music and discern all the qualities and instruments.  The treble is sparkly, the midrange is presented in full, and the bass although not overpowering, is punchy and does not overshadow the treble or the midrange.  However if I really want bass, the m50 surely deliver as they respond very well to equalization.  After a few days with these phones, I can now understand what audiophiles mean by quality headphones and the production of a flat response and overall excellent musical balance & soundstage image.As many users have stated, these phones may not sound their best right out of the box.  Upon the first hour of listening it was a joy when compared to my v700dj's. I can confidently say that the m50 really blow the v700dj's right out of the water when talking about clarity across the spectrum.  I think I have racked up approximately 40 hours on the m50's and I believe they sound much better when compared to right out of the box.  Without being detailed, the overall music quality has improved and the bass for me is fuller and well rounded.  From what I have read, these m50 sound their best after 100 hours of burning in, and I can't to hear mine when they get to that point!\"},\n",

I prefer to think of them as revealing.  Doing A-B comparisons between these and other high quality headphones, I find:1. Sennheiser HD 439: The Sennheisers are smooth and non-fatiguing, and very lightweight and comfortable, with decent sound isolation.  However, the sound is very muffled compared to the ATH-M50s.  They seem to have upper bass and midrange overemphasis in comparison, like a veil was thrown over the music.  Listening to the muffle picked guitar sections of STP's &#34;Plush&#34;, I could clearly hear the clicks and really hear what was going on in the guitar parts with the ATH-M50s.  I could not at all with the HD 439s.2. B&W; P3: I actually paid more for the B&Ws; than I did the ATH-M50s, and these B&Ws; really are beautifully made, portable and compact headphones.  But the sound is hopelessly colored in comparison to the Audio Technicas.  Upper bass bloat from the P3s is even more pronounced than the HD 439s.  Highest treble registers are less muffled, but still not revealing enough.  The B&W; P3s are decent portable headphones, but they are not even close to the ATH-M50 in terms of sound quality.3. Grado SR80i: these headphones were by far the closest to the ATH-M50 in terms of neutrality, reavealingness, clarity, and overall sound quality.  They are noticeably less efficient, so matching volume level is essential.  The Grados are also open air, open-backed headphones, which can make for a bit more of an airy soundstage.  The Grados sound good in just about every aspect, though I did sense that the upper treble registers weren't quite as defined or as 'etched' as with the ATH-M50s.  That would make sense, as the Grados are more of an audiophile type unit, versus the ATs, which seem more geared towards mixing.  Both have very smooth, detailed midrange, but I would give the ATH-M50s the definite nod in terms of low, punchy bass.  It's hard to beat a good pair of sealed headphones like these, especially on-ear open-air phones like the Grados.Build quality is not super plush, but definitely well made and seemingly durable.  Earcups fold in for stowage in the included plastic pouch.  I also like the high quality cord with the last foot or so of coils.  It also comes with a high quality 3.5mm plug with a screw-on 6.3mm adapter.  The cord is not removable, which is only a minor complaint, especially at this price point.Once you compare these Audio Technica ATH-M50s to much sonically inferior headphones like Dr. Dre Beats and the like, you'll never want to go back.  These headphones simply sound great.\"},\n",

       "  'review': '(Note: I later upped my rating (3 to 4) but left the original content - see UPDATE below)(ORIGINAL REVIEW - Disappointed considering the hype..)When I searched about burn in time (in the hope they\\'d improve) for these I read a review that quoted the treble sounded \"piercing and sibilant\" and although that\\'s harsh its actually pretty accurate - I find myself skipping tracks to find one that sounds ok?!And the sound stage and expansiveness is really not there, quite flat sounding - I\\'ve read that in a few places too.So far I\\'ve played them for about 12 hours since receiving them ($125usd from Amazon - shipped from the US) and kinda doubt they\\'re going to improve that much with more play time to make me want to keep them. I\\'m not a audiophile but do have pretty decent hifi gear and in my opinion (in laymans terms) the longer (and louder) you can listen to something and enjoy it the better the sound quality probably is. I\\'m struggling to enjoy these at any volume - I found a handful of tracks that sounds pretty good but honestly not many. Either the manufacturing standards for these are a bit suss and I got a crap pair or these things are just not all they\\'re cracked up to be.Will give them a few more nights of \\'burn in\\' and will report back on whether they improve dramatically, or not. At this stage I have to say its likely that I will return or sell them - which honestly is a PITA because these were shipped to NZ.For interests sake (and the sake of some credibility) my home setup is: B&W; CM8s, McLaren A150B amp, modded Pioneer cd player, Xindak cables.UPDATE (18July2012)I have to take back some of what I wrote - the bit where I talk of the treble being \"piercing and sibilant\". This turned out to be due to the USB dac i was using (Musiland Monitor 01 US). For whatever reason that dac is not suited to these phones - I learnt this when I simply plugged the phones directly into my laptop headphone jack and instantly noticed the piercing treble was gone. The treble is actually rather nice - clear, crisp, quite forward and well pronounced?.I\\'m still in the process of finding a \\'decent\\' headphone amp and will report back again once I have one. (If I still have these phones).The sound stage issue is still there but maybe that will improve somewhat with a decent amp?!And although the treble issue is gone the longest I can last with these things on is about 30mins after which I need to let my ears cool down. I get hot easily though so..?Definitely on the look out for phones that are cooler to wear (ie. open backed) and the next level up sound wise. I\\'ve listened to a friends senheisser hd555\\'s (which we modded to be 595s). They are super comfortable, cool, and have better sound stage - or at least a lot more open sounding, but sound quite recessed and rolled off (treble) compared to the athm50s - is recessed the right word? and the athm50s have a much better base response, deeper and more refined.To be continued..'},\n",

       "  'review': \"Love them!While I was deployed the last third of 2010 I spent much of my time with only the basic electronics I took with me to the desert. A nice set of headphones was not on this list. While time passed I met a few dudes who also wanted new headphones, so we all went different directions with this itch. We bought a set of Bose, Beats, and I got the M50 with a FiiO E5 amp.By default, Bose disapointed for the price and lost. What we found was that the M50 headphones were absolutely the most faithful to the acuracy of the sound, but lacked the deep bass the Beats could produce. You could still hear the bass, but not so much FEEL the bass.  Deep down inside I wanted that in these, and I envied the Beats but I undestood why it lacked this. On the Beats once the bass get heavy everything else becomes a sea of distorted garbage flowing into your ears. Soon after we noticed this we also heard a soft hiss on the Bose and Beats whenever they were powered on with soft or no music. The M50 only suffered this when I installed the amp, and without it, they were perfectly quiet when nothing was playing. Why would I plug in an amp then if it added a hiss? Well, this little moFiiO could make the bass on these pop. At the higher volumes I usually played music with bass, the hiss was undetectable. As other reviews have stated the bass is clean and balanced definitely punchy. Just don't expect to have a tiny ghetto blaster(see Beats) in each ear. If bass is what you want the Beats will slap a smile across your face. If clarity you seek these make this your new baby.So you're a random dude who just wants new headphones because you want an upgrade, not to use them profesionally. Should you buy these headphones? Go through this list, maybe it'll help.Score out of 5. Here we go!ROCK-YES! *****I've heard little things that I could never notice with my other headphones. Every cymbal heard. Quiet voices emerged.POSTROCK & ORCHESTRAL-R U Fn Me? *****When the music is so calm any bass instruments really punch in contrast. You can hear the fingers slide across strings like you were there.BASS HEAVY-PurdyGud ****-Base suffices but leaves me feeling like I should have ran away with the Beats. Is it concidered cheating? I mean I haven't even listen to the Beats in months... but I still think of them. I wonder if they think of me.Video Games. SWEET  ****-I play a lot of first person shooters with headphones for 2 reasons. I like to give my wife time to read in peace and I enjoy the advantage of having directional hearing in games like these. Absolutely worth it in Call of Duty. But again, there are explosions in this game. What I've done is set up my home theater subwoofer along with my headphones to play what I'd miss out on. Feel the bass from the box, hear crispy details with my head flapsVERY Loud places (see FlightLine) just good ***-- with barely any noice isolating capabilities, using these while mowing or any other loud scenario will force you to blast them if you want to hear the music... and damage your ears. I'd suggest a nice set Ultimate Ears or Sure earbuds for this task.Comfort ***** for the first few hours, but then it goes down to ***-- when the top of your head is screaming for more padding but you can't take them off because your ears want more cowbell. Sliding a little bit of fleese fabric under them makes a wonderful difference.Overall, I love them. I'd recomend them any day. If you're wondering if you should go with the straight cord or coil. I prefered the coil due to practicality. They are comfortable unless you're using them for HOURS.\"},\n",

From personal experience, these headphones, at under two hundred, compete with headphones in the two-to-three hundred dollar range. The bass is solid, but most importantly, the mids and highs aren't over-equalized like you get with plenty other cans around this price range. Very clear all around. It should be noted that the backs are closed and plastic. Still, after you break them in, they're wonderful, and I use them for general mixing in a variety of pitch ranges (though mostly vocal tracks and some bass). The build, too, is surprisingly solid. Don't underestimate good construction, even if you're aiming for high sound quality.Even if you're a casual music listener that has mostly used cheaper headphones or earphones, while I know that this may very well be above your price range, I guarantee that these are well worth your money, and that you will hear things that you never even knew existed, even in songs that you have listened to for YEARS.

I upgraded from regular apple headphones to the ATH-M30 and when i heard how much an improvement the M50's were i immediately sold the M30 after only owning them for a day and ordered the M50.PROS:-Good clean/controlled bass-good clean treble. (R&B; vocals sounded great)-Comfortable-DurableCONS:-Ears can get a bit sweaty-the mids are a bit recessed though a little bit of EQ should fix the problem-The cord is a bit much to handle (11ft)These are great headphones for the price. I shopped around and eventually landed on these and am not disappointed. These headphones sound very crisp and clear and can push very high volumes without distorting. The bass is really clean and controlled, the trebles are clear while not being too sharp, but the mids are a bit recessed. The comfort of these is top notch but the drawback is that your ears can get a bit hot. I wear these headphones for about 2-3 hours a day straight and my ears are not fatigued at all and i listen to them on pretty high volume. Now for rap, rnb, and rock these headphones are awesome. They sound good unamped since they are low impedence but sound amazing with an amp. I run it through a fiio e11 out of my samsung droid charge and these headphones sound amazing. They blow Beats by dre studio headphones out of the water because the sound is overall more balanced and its less then half the price. They look sleek as well being all black with that little hit of silver. The greatest part about these headphones is when my music is on, i can't hear anyone and they can't hear my music. These are very public friendly and perfect for the library, bus ride, plane ride etc. IF you are on the fence with these i would say go ahead and buy them and if you really don't like them, take advantage of amazon's good return policy. If by chance you are comparing these with the ultrasone hfi 780, i would say pick the m50 because the sound is more balanced and neutral. The ultrason hfi 780 hurt my ears because the treble is too harsh. These are very good balanced headphones that are good for just about every music genre. Take a leap of faith!\"},\n",

I've paid $100 for headphones that didn't sound nearly this good.They're comfortable, and I'm told I have a rather large head. I've bent the band slightly (and carefully) so they're not tight fitting, and it didn't hurt them. They're definitely well built. I'd describe many of my previous headphones as being like cheap toys in comparison, and they broke easily. I will say that I have the coiled cord, and it's a little heavy.I use them for listening to music, movies and games on my computer, which is connected to a stereo receiver. Without that or a headphone amp, I could see how they could lack bass somewhat.I don't understand or care one way or the other about &#34;burn-in&#34;. However I do think they sound better after putting some music through them, compared to when I first heard them, but I could be wrong.Couldn't be more happy with this purchase.\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"I agree with most other reviewers in that the sound quality of these headphones is superb. I hear things in songs that I never noticed before, everything comes through clear, the sound isolation when music is playing is excellent (but not noise-cancelling, as I found out on a long road trip). I'm also glad I got the coiled cord as it's the perfect length and can be extended if need be.After about a month of using these, I went back to a previous pair of Sony headphones ($80 if I remember correctly) that I'd been using for the past 3 years, just to compare, and there was absolutely no comparison. Listening through the Sony's sounds like listening through a tin can. Like someone on the other side of a paper-cup string communication device was playing music. That proved to me that the bang for the buck you get with these headphones is outstanding. Leaps ahead of the $80 Sonys for about $30 more. So worth it.Also, I bought these without a headphone amplifier and have no problem with audio levels when set to 1/2 strength and above on my iPod.My only complaint is comfort. These things are pretty heavy, and hefty. They do fold up nicely, though, and I like the carrying case they came with. But I don't see how anyone could comfortably wear these for more than a few hours at a time. The first few minutes they feel secure and form fitting, but they become noticeably uncomfortable after about 1.5 hours of listening, so much so that I have to shift around the headband every 20 minutes or so after the 1.5 hour mark. I suppose that after a few more months of putting them on and stretching the headband, this problem will go away, but I'll have to see about that.  Also, as expected with heavy, closed air headphones, they can get hot. Not that the headphones themselves do, but wearing them heats up your ears noticeably because of them being enclosed the whole time.That said, I find ways around it, because listening with these is worth bearing a bit of discomfort. You can pay more to get lighter headphones, or possibly open-air ones where you need to be in a quiet room to hear everything, but to me, I'd rather get the most bang for the buck, and enjoy the sound isolation and amazing sound from these while adjusting the headband and dealing with a bit of heat.\"},\n",

       "  'review': 'For Christmas, my wife and I got our son a black beats studio; a nice pink solo for my daughter; and I got her a beats tour. I was going to stay content with my trusty v-moda bass freq (I\\'m at an age where it\\'s really no longer fun to say names like that) which had withstood two complete cycles in the washer-and-dryer but was still sounding good. But I always found myself borrowing my son\\'s studio. He calls it the headphones that \"introduced me to instruments I had never heard in songs I had listened to many, many times before.\" I had to agree with him: not that there\\'s a lot of technical sophistication about Head Over Heels by TFF, but it never sounded so good. I didn\\'t care if the active noise-cancelling inherently affected the quality of the sound (I would not have been able to tell the difference); it was way better than any of the headphones or ear buds I had owned.So I decided to get grownup headphones. I was done with the cheap stuff that I had to replace so often anyway (and which includes a pair of Bose in-ears that broke after a couple of months of handling with extreme care). I also did not want a fourth Dre in the household.I started with CNET, where I found the ATH-M50. Followed it to Amazon, where I found it at the top of the circumaural heap. I checked out a few Youtube reviews as well. The amazing consistency of the comments from the 5- and 4-star reviewers was the biggest factor in my decision to buy them. USPS delivered them to my doorstep yesterday, and I now agree with every good thing that has been said about it (in non-technical and non-audiophile language). Bass is punchy right out of the box, although I am heeding the advice of many to burn it in. I have about 4 days worth of continuous music in my iTunes library, and I put it to work before going to bed last night. The treble makes you feel like there are hundreds of little tweeters on the earpieces. I played songs from a wide variety of genres in my library, streamed from Pandora, broadcast on TuneIn Radio - every single one is a whole new experience. Movies on Netflix are also so much more alive. I had no idea how much detail I had been missing through my previous phones and buds. Come Together was the song that made my son\\'s jaw drop when he put on his beats for the first time; it sounds even better on these.One thing I will say to those who have yet to say anything or offer judgment about the ATH-M50: there is a huge difference between listening to it on an iPod/iPhone (unless maybe you have a headphone amp, which I can\\'t speak to since I don\\'t have one) and listening to it on a PC or a Mac. Nothing underwhelming about the iPhone experience, but listening to it on the Mac was nothing short of a religious revelation especially for a guy who had settled for a twice-laundered buds for so long.I\\'d like to thank my son, who let me use his beats until I got my own cans. He loves all things Japanese, and he reminded me that in an age of bling marketing and packaging, Japanese design still kicks ass.'},\n",

       "  'review': \"The ATH-M50 is a very good pair of headphones.  I bought these to purely listen to music through my iPhone/iPod.  The sound is Great.  There are over the ear headphones.  They are not Noice Cancelling, but they do limit outside noise when you put them on.  I listen to all types of music by primarily Rock and Hard Rock.  I prefer the ATH-M50 over Beats by Dre.  My friend has the Beats by Dre headphones that are not the Noice Cancelling.  These fit on the ear and are not comfortable.  The advantage of these is the Bass.  These hit a bit harder on Bass and have a slightly increase amplification all songs.  However, the sound is not as crisp and clear as the ATH-M50's.  If you are primarily listening to R&B;, Rap and other heavy Bass songs and you like heavy Bass, Beats by Dre may be the headphones to consider.  However, the ATH-M50 sounds great with R&B;, Rap and other types of music and the price is below other Named Brand Headphones. The sound is very crisp and clear and all songs sound Great!I fully recommend the Audio-Technica ATH-M50 Professional Studio Monitor Headphones.\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"Before buying these, I bought the KRK KNS-8400s.  I had them for about 3 days.  Without reviewing them here, I'll just say that they burned in well, and were spectacular in their reproduction of mids and highs.  The bass, though, was too understated for me.  I'm a bit of a basshead, but for headphones, I will settle for accurate reproduction that is clear and balanced in the 30-80Hz range.  The KRKs just didn't have that.  But they were conspicuously good in mids and highs.  I could hear the bow moving across the strings of a cello, as well as the sound from the cello's resonating chamber.  I could hear a lot of the sound engineers' mistakes, too.These, on the other hand, won't dazzle you in that kind of way.  I try to pay attention to the sound of these headphones, but I end up just paying attention to the sound of the music.  They're inconspicuous.  They reproduce the bass faithfully without being at all boomy (like the Bose Triports I had previously).  Everything sounds just the way it should.  I've read a great deal about the V-shape in the sound these produce, but it's not something that would keep a music lover with sensitive ears from enjoying what they do.  Voices and guitars are sufficiently present, crisp and clear.  You can hear the picks on the strings, if you pay attention.They're comfortable, though not as comfortable as my old Bose Triports.  They're suitable for hours of continuous listening.  They don't wear out the ear like the KRKs did.I'm not done with the burn-in on these headphones, but I don't expect it will make that noticeable a difference.  I find it impossible to carefully critique the sound that these headphones make-- I just get too caught up in enjoying the music.  And that's about perfect.  That's just the way headphones, or any speakers, ought to be.  I recommend that you buy these headphones.  You could spend hundreds more for headphones that might wow you more than these will, but if you just want to enjoy music the way it should sound, these are perfect and reasonably priced.\"},\n",

I bought them to replace some Denon DN-HP1000 DJ headphones, which were replacements for the Sony MD700 DJ headphones. I was considering the Sennheiser HP25's but went with these because of the price and the almost universally excellent reviews here and on other audiophile forums.I also own the Ultimate Ears Super.fi 5EB's, so I'm no stranger to solid bass from a pair of headphones. All I can say is that the bass isn't as in your face as the EB's, but it's just as substantial and much cleaner, along with MUCH better highs and mids. Music just sparkles on these and I'm only about 15 hours in. Can't wait to see what they sound like after 50 hours of burn-in.Fit and finish is impeccable. They seem sturdy as hell. They're pretty large so I wouldn't buy these as your main pair of portable headphones for streetwalking and whatnot, but for at home or stationary use pretty much anywhere, I'm not sure how you could beat these for the price. I'm hearing things in my music that I have never heard, and these are tunes that I have listened many times from many sources. Really top notch pair of cans.In case anyone is wondering, I listen primarily to electronic music (techno, tech-house, electro house, dubstep), with a decent amount of hip-hop and reggae thrown in. All bass-driven music so I'm biased in that respect, but it's an accomplishment to have bass like this and still present the rest of the music so well.I'm listening to them unamped from my MacbookPro and they sound fantastic, so anyone wondering if you need to plunk down extra cash for a fancy amp, don't worry about that either.I haven't had a chance to listen to the HD25's or the new Shure SRH-840, which seem to be targeting the same demographic.

I've tested some of the most talked about phones at the time.What I can say with no doubt: Do not be fooled by Beats or Skullcandy. Both audio quality or material quality are lame.They have muffled bass and the sound is definitely not crystal clear. You can't hear bass, mids and treble clearly. And do you want something that looks is going to break when you're handling it?Every day that I burn my ATH-M50 Audio-Technica (And I use them everyday, for at least 4-5 hours when working), I feel that I've made the right choice.This headphone is one of the things I've bought lately that I have more joy to use.The best thing on this ATH-M50 is that you listen to music the way it was recorded for you to listen. The sound clarity is really impressive.And it doesn't have any distortions nor fake basses.It's one of the best headphones that I've ever had.Hope this helps you decide, or, at least, warns you about Beats and Skulcandys, they're really no good compared to this Audio-Technica beauty.\"},\n",

Like you may be doing I read countless reviews looking for a nice set.I settled on the ATH-M50's and let me tell you they do not disappoint. Big surprise? Probably not...Comfort:Some reviews led me to believe that the headphones could be uncomfortable and I have yet to find this to be true (after about 2-3 hours of use) with my medium-large head.This being said I am used to bulky gaming headsets (the most recent being the WoW Soundblaster Headset).These headphones are about half the weight of my last WoW pair, they were a lot smaller than I expected!Sound:Like I said, not an audiophile. Despite this I notice a massive change in the depth of music I hear! Music out of my old headphones was a tangled bunch of sound.With this M50's everything is clear and distinguishable.I have not had substantial time to burn these and and I am still awe struck by the beauty of the music I listen to (which is about everything minus Jazz, Country and death metal).The bass off the bat is boomy and impressive.In the beginning of my headphone search I was sure I wanted exaggerated bass like something the beats would offer.These phones offer more than enough bass to satisfy me and I listen to a ton of rap, hip-hop, techno or techno-esque music. After some substantial burn in I will ideally update this section.Comments:Though sometimes I will toy around with mixing programs I am by no means using these as studio-phones.These are purely for my listening pleasure. Coming from my relatively inexperienced stand-point I say you definitely can't go wrong with these babies.They are audio-bliss.\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"I have been reading reviews on the ATH-M50 for a while.  Last week, I finally got a chance to get one locally off craigslist for $35 used.  After I cleaned the headphone and the pad, it's ready for listening.The physical aspect of the M50 is very simple.  The fit is very good and built quality is excellent.  The padding is a little thin.  Because of the thin padding and hard clamp force, I would rate it 6.5/10 for comfort .  And 9.5/10 for built quality. It is extremely flexible and hard material. Now let's get to the important part, the music. How does it sound? The M50 is very musical! The high is sparkly and clear with very little sibilant on just a few songs.  The bass is deep, and quantity wise it is just enough. The mid and vocal are slightly recessed but that makes the bass and high sounds much better.  I would say the whole sound is very well balanced with a little emphasize on the bass and the high. In order to hear nice and clean sound, the type of mp3 files to use should be 192kbps or better.  At first, I tried some 128kbps and the sound was so bad with a lot of noise.  I would recommend 320kbps files or lossless.  With the retail price of around $159 right now, I think it's still a good buy.  It is a steal if you can still get it for less than $120.  That's it for this review.  I will revisit later with new updates.\"},\n",

Hearing things you've never heard before in songs you've supposedly listened to a hundred times?Well, I can tell you it's true! I'm a bit of an audiophile (recently admitted), and so I thought I knew my favorite songs in and out. It turns out, I was missing things! With high quality recordings, I can hear little details in the guitar riffs, the clarity of the high hats, and the occasional ruffling of the musician's clothing. I even heard someone's watch go off in a choral recording that I'd listened to dozens of times... I had never heard it before!Of course, with this comes a word of caution. It will make low quality recordings sound TERRIBLE. If there's distortion in the upper register, you WILL hear it, and it WILL drive you insane. This is actually a common problem in modern music, one that I couldn't hear with my old Skull Candy earbuds. If your music library is full of crappy recordings, I'd recommend fixing that issue before getting these headphones if you really want to enjoy them.\"},\n",

Probably the only negative thing I could say would be that they don't have a detachable cord, which wasn't a big deal to me.The one other thing I can say against them is that because of their quality they've spoiled me to inferior headphones and speakers. Lows, mids and highs are right where they should be. They're excellent across genres and musical ranges; they don't emphasize any one component of the sound but instead shine in each. I listen to electronic music, classical, and classic/prog rock for the most part, and the M50's perform beautifully in each.One other note: I was originally considering the ATH M50S, which is identical other than having a straight cable rather than a coiled one. I ended up with these because the M50S was out of stock when I ordered, but I'm now glad that it was. The coiled cable ended up being perfect - it doesn't tangle, and is only about 1m at its shortest rather than 3m like the straight version. This means that the coiled version can extend to the full 3m when you need it to, but also works outside of the home when you don't want something overly long and unwieldy.Absolutely recommended - if you're looking for an amazing set that won't break the bank, and outperforms headphones at a much higher price point, these are for you. Build quality is also great, and the headphones feel very durable. I can honestly say that they're one of the best purchases I've ever made.\"},\n",

I recently graduated from a very dated but still excellent sounding pair of Sennheiser HD280's, of which I was quite pleased with the sound of as well. The Sennheiser headphones, while fantastic, are in my opinion, inferior in every way aside from cinematic audio quality, to the ATH-M50's. The M50's provide a very rugged build quality, keeping key joints as far away from points of tension as possible. The audio quality is very well balanced, providing a nice full bass, balanced mid-range, and cutting but far from overpowering upper range. Unlike the Sennheiser HD280's, which feature a very warm, slightly damp cinematic sound, the M50's favor a very crisp and clear output. Between the two, which sounds better for average listening is preference, however the M50's are far superior for mixing, for this reason.The only downsides to these headphones, as far as I'm concerned are that the wire doesn't detach at the ear, a feature which many higher end headphones have been adding, as of late, and that they don't come with a hard case. To some, they may also seem unusually tight fitting (in terms of pressure) at first, but this loosens up with use, some, and hasn't been a cause of discomfort to me.All in all, if you're looking for excellent sounding headphones on a budget, and want something built to last, or are in need of a new pair of headphones for mixing, I would definitely recommend the ATH-M50's.\"},\n",

They still work perfectly fine and dont look 2 years old.Comfort 7/10: the ath m50s' pads were great to start with but after 6 months the pleather earpads are very hard so i didnt want to have to buy 20 dollar earpads every six months so i bought the shure earpads that people say work on these too. they were way more comfortable but they also swiveled around on the earcups and left some bass to be desired so those are some things to consider.Build Quality 9/10: The first few months i had these i was a real stickler about taking care of them because i was afraid of breaking the non detachable cord. I decided to pop the headphones open to see how the cord was held in there. Theres two thick pegs that the cord raps around before it attaches to the driver. That eased my non detachable cord woes. I got these for 85 at guitar center because i came from the pioneer hdj 500's which had a cracked headband and the cord that goes from the headband to the cup got mangled so i had the warranty and got my money back on those. Definitely built like a tank i've dropped these maybe 6 times. no chips, scratches, scuffs. I'm really not nice to them at all. The headband padding looks like if you pull on it too hard itll rip out or tear but it hasn't after my abuse so i guess its not going to.Looks 7/10: These headphones are a great looking headphone but wont turn heads as much as some. They're definitely pretty bulky on your head so if you look at yourself in the mirror with them on you kind of look stupid but any other angle they look pretty good.Sound 8/10: When i got these i had seen all of the reviews saying they're the best sound quality for the buck and all that and i agree up to a point. Now i know these are studio monitor headphones but i wouldn't use them to make music. they have a pleasant, clear, neutral sound. But its far from flat. Theirs a hump in the bass around 80 hz that makes music sound more pleasant but would be terrible for mixing bass professionally.\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"For the price ($116), you would be hard pressed to find a better sounding pair of closed headphones.  The bass is astonishingly deep but can be a bit loose at times.  The highs border on sibilance but add a visceral edge to the music, never subtracting from the sound quality.  The midrange, on the other hand, is recessed.  Effectively, it sounds as if the singer is placed much further back than the other instruments and performers.  Personally, I find this trait undesirable.  Given the closed design, the soundstage--even after the crossfeed plugin, Isone, was applied--is quite narrow.Despite these criticisms, overall, the relative sound-quality is high and enjoyable.My greatest complaint with these headphones is the comfort, or rather, lack there of.  Maybe I am a wuss, but after just 30 minutes of listening, discomfort sets in as the headband and its stitching digs into my hair and scalp, creating almost a burning sensation.  Understandably, this distracts from the musical enjoyment and often leads to interruptions as the headphones must be removed to relieve the discomfort.  The clamping pressure on these headphones is on the moderate side, further emphasizing the weight of the headband on the user's head.Two versions of this headphone are available:  the coiled version (ATH-M50) and the straight cable version (ATH-M50s).  The sound quality, presumably, is identical but in a practical sense, a difference does exist:  the coiled cable is heavy and tends to pull obnoxiously at the left earpiece when one moves more than 4ft away from the source the headphones are plugged into.  The straight cable is 12ft long and allows for a much greater freedom of movement while sacrificing compactness.Finally, be careful when ordering these headphones from the Instrument Store.  Although the price was phenomenal, the product received did not exactly match the product described.  I ordered the straight cable versions but received the coiled cable versions instead.  For this reason, the product was returned to Amazon for a full refund.\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"I got these headphones at the beginning of January as a Christmas present.  I wanted something that would sound good and most importantly block out conversations around me.  I almost got the Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones for triple the price, but fortunately I read reviews for both these and the Bose and I am so glad I did.  One thing the reviews made clear was that for the Bose, you were paying almost entirely for the sound cancellation, and most other aspects of the headphones were inferior.  And the noise cancellation was primarily best at blocking loud continuous noise, not dynamic conversations.  These headphones provide MORE than enough noise blockage.  If they are at a decent volume, I cannot hear anything else, unless someone is yelling at me from 5 feet away.  And I've tried them on noisy bus rides and they easily block that noise as well.  Why pay three times more for the Bose?  Ya got me.  Get these headphones and save yourself $200.  The cord thickness and other construction aspects of these headphones are top notch as well, so I suspect they will last quite a while (a nice change from my previous headphones).\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"The Audio-Technica ATH-M50 headphones are a great portable, travel, or DJ headphone because of their closed-back design and high sensitivity rating (99 dB). They are extremely durable and have a very high-quality construction. I would liken their build quality and feel to Sony or Shure headphones. Although, these don't utilize noise-cancelling technology, they still drown out the majority of external noise, and don't distort the sound as much as noise-cancelling headphones.These headphones are perfect for DJs or 'bassheads' as they're able to cancel out a lot of ambient sound and have a really strong bass signature. Additionally, the cable only comes out of one side so it is designed for DJ use.The only downside to these is that they don't have the highest sound quality in regards to accuracy of sound stage, especially the highs (treble). Although, these have better sound stage than bass-heavy Sony headphones (e.g. MDR-V6, XB500), they aren't quite on par to Shure SRH940 or Denon AH-D2000 -- however, they are significantly less expensive and still are enjoyable for the listener. If you have discriminating taste regarding the upper tonal ends, I would recommend the Shure SRH840/SRH940 in the ~$200 price range or Denon AH-D2000 if you want a more refined overall sound that still has good bass-emphasis.\"},\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ll start by saying that I am not an audiophile but I have good hearing and can judge the sound coming from headphones with good accuracy according to my subjective taste. Just don\\'t expect in-depth analysis from my review. ;)My taste is usually to have an all around good sound, which means a good amount of treble, mids and bass but nothing overpowered. I can\\'t talk about the \"sound stage\" part of the sound because I never experienced a good sound stage with the headphones I used so far but I heard the ATH-M50\\'s have poor sound stage for those interested in this aspect.I got a pair of these headphones after reading all the reviews on the net of people saying that these headphones were fabulous for the price and could even beat headphones that are marked at twice the price. People also say that they are even all around which is what I want.I must say after listening to them a lot that these headphones are simply fabulous and really deliver on what I expected and are the best sounding pair of headphones I listened to so far.I tried a lot of headphones last week-end since I know a friend with a lot of headphones. Sure I couldn\\'t try them out for a long time but enough to know that out of all the headphones I tried these ATH-M50\\'s were still the best ones for my taste at first glance.The treble and especially mids for the vocals are the best I\\'ve heard. They are so clear and clean but not exagerrated or harsh to the ears at all even at higher volumes. The bass is definitely plenty enough. I don\\'t understand reviewers that say that the bass is lacking. I would even remove a little bass from these headphones and they would sound even better. The bass is very present and clean but never destroys the vocals or treble.Comfort-wise, I would say they are pretty good. I have a small head and I don\\'t open them at all. I wear them fully closed out like they are when you take them out of the box. I find the arc on the top of my head to be a little uncomfortable because the cushion is too thin but the sides that goes on the ears are fine for me. It is true that the ears can become hot when you are in a hot place but if you don\\'t tend to sweat easily like me they won\\'t be a problem.Noise-cancellation: I tried those in the subway and they don\\'t cancel enough background noise to be usuable in these situations (subway sound is very loud). In the bus it\\'s better but you can still hear the backgound noise. They block some of it though but don\\'t expect a miracle on this aspect.I tried the following headphones in comparison:Bose Quiet Comfort 15: I only tried these at the Best Buy test outlet so I can\\'t say much about them but the sound seemed decent. The outlet played guitar and light music though so I can\\'t judge the bass with that. The noise cancelling was marvelous. It blocked 95% of the constant background noise but I can\\'t stand the feeling of the noise cancelling on my eardrums (pressure is what I feel).Beats studio: Sounded like garbage compared to the ATH-M50s. The sound in general was bad all around and I dislike the feeling on my eardrums of active cancelling. I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever be able to endure active cancelling headphones and that\\'s a pity since they usually block constant background noise very good.Beats pro: Great sound. Way better than the studios but bass is a little too much. The rest is similar to the ATHM50\\'s. Good treble and vocals but too much bass really... They are also heavy and tights on the head so the comfort is not the best but it wasn\\'t terrible either. They seem to be in aluminium so they probably have crazy durability. I am still thinking about maybe picking a pair of these anyway but would need to test them out more because the bass might become tiresome to bear after some time.AKG 172: These sounded like garbage to me and I really dislike the on the ear comfort-wise. Very uncomfortable and tight on the ears.AKG-272 around the ear: These sounded great. The treble was off the roof but the bass was very absent. They seem to need a portable amp because they have too much ohm (65 I think) and I had to put the volume on my ipod too high. They are not a good option for me because I use my ipod to listen to music pretty much all of the time. I\\'m sure they sound great with an amp though. I really like the over the head band system. Extremely comfortable. On the other hand I didn\\'t like the grip on the sides. It\\'s not tight enough so the headphones had a tendancy to move a little on my head making some noise when they rubbed on my ears a little.Some headphones with the earpieces looking like old-style microphones (don\\'t know the brand or model number): These sounded so bad I took them off after seconds of listening to some music with them.Bose triport (or AE1 like some like to call them): I own these and always thought they sounded awesome and were very comfortable. The ATH-M50S sound better for sure but the triport are still a good pair of headphones with good (but not great) treble, mids and bass. You will definitely hear more detail with the ATH-M50\\'s than you do with a pair of triports and in all departments (treble, mids and bass). The ATH-M50\\'s are even a little less costy on Amazon now than the triports used to be.Bose AE2i: I recently bought a pair of these because I like my triports and decided I would probably like the new version. I also wanted a mic for my ipod on a pair of comfortable Bose. I was very disappointed by the sound compared to the triports. The main problem for me is the treble. It is way too exagerrated on the AE2i. Basically, they added treble and removed bass compared to the triports, so the sound is very flat sounding. The fact that they removed bass is not the major problem for me because it\\'s still present, it\\'s the treble that I can\\'t stand. Too much treble makes my ears very uncomfortable to the point where I can\\'t listen to music if the treble is too high pitched or too loud (like in rock concerts where I have to put plugs in my ears, which anyway is a must if you don\\'t want to damage your hearing). I think the sound is a step in the right direction but they over-emphasized the treble too much. Another reason why I find this a pity is that these headphones are so comfortable it\\'s like putting pillows on your ears and they weight nothing. They are clearly more comfortable than the triports even. I\\'ll be returning these to BestBuy now that I have my ATH-M50\\'s and still have my triports. Pity...Razer Orca headphones: When I saw these and when my friend told me the price he paid for them, I was skeptical even if my friend told me they sounded great for the price. I must admit these headphones sound great! When you look at them, they look like a geeky toy (which I don\\'t mind that much really since I am a geek) but they deliver great treble, mids and bass. The ATH-M50 still sound better in treble, mids and bass but frankly the Razer are not that far behind. Comfort-wise they were better than the ATH-M50\\'s to me but they didn\\'t seem to close enough. I noticed though that it seems like you can unscrew a screw on the sides to maybe make the headphones close a little more so they would be tighter on my head. The side cushions weren\\'t the best but the overall weight of the headphones makes them very comfortable anyway. If you\\'re on a budget I recommend these headphones compared to all the above I listed (the beats pro sound great but they are 450$ and for bass heads and the AKG272 needs an amp). For 50$ you can\\'t go wrong. Note that the sound leaks out a little more than with the other models I tried but they are closed headphones nonethenless and not open.So out of the bunch:ATH-M50 still the best sounding onesRazer Orca second best sounding onesBeats Pro probably equal to the Orca\\'s but a different sound because way more bassBose Triports: Good sounding headphones but the above headphones are better and Bose don\\'t make these anymore.The AKG 272\\'s sound great but they need an amp so not good for me.The rest is not good enough for my taste.'},\n",

I've been using these for about three or four weeks and they are pretty much perfect. I'm not an audiophile or musician, but a college student who wanted high-quality headphones that would last a long time, and I'm glad I bought these because they seem like they can stand a little abuse, are stylish, and more unique than other headphone brands that half the New Yorkers I see use nowadays. I've worn these in the rain and they started to make an odd noise after an hour or so, but they were fine after I took them off, dried them, and stored them in my bag. I wear these around my neck when I shouldn't listen to music because they're great as a kind of fashion accessory too. I kind of hope that these headphones don't explode in popularity as Beats have, but I also kind of do because people should listen to music the way it was meant to be heard, not with amped-up bass and mediocre everything else!\"},\n",

I love them. I now have 100% confidence in mixing multi-tracks and fine tuning the mix by applying EQ and compression to the tracks because these headphones really do have an amazingly accurate, flat frequency response. Many famous producers have said that these headphones have given them an accurate mix that translates well to even the most expensive monitors.Before I got the ATH M50s, I used to try and mix songs that had a bass guitar, electric guitar, drums, vocals, and piano by using my crappy iPod headphones. BIG MISTAKE. The songs were always out of wack because some instruments were always way louder than they should be (or way quieter), simply because the headphones I was using were lying to me.

The only problems I have with these headphones is the length of the straight chord (about 6 feet) and the lack of volume control next to the ear, and honestly these two complaints dont really matter when you compare the overall sound quality of these phones to anything else in their price range, or even $200 more for that matter.

They are bulky so if you are looking for something small to take on the plane, these may not be the best for you, but if you don't care about that then I highly recommend picking up a pair of these. I must say, I've heard a lot about allowing these headphones a burn-in time about about 40 hours or so before they reach their optimum output and sound quality, but I didn't notice a huge difference and the sound has always been terrific.

       "  'review': 'I favor pro-sumer products. Such products are made for professional use, but are accessible to savvy consumers. The M50s match that definition. These headphones are used in musician\\'s studios when mastering and mixing their work. The sound is flat, meaning there is no coloration or artificial audio cosmetics going on. A bad recording will be almost unlistenable, but a good recording will sound heavenly. They tell the truth.After about a 50 hour burn-in these cans will come alive for you. The highs are crystal clear with no sibilance at all, mids are complex, convincing and so realistic. Bass response is deep and throaty, not rumbly or muddy...no artificial sound. It is easy to pick out each instrument and to locate it in the sound stage. No wonder these phones are in such demand by professional musicians. The audio quality is just excellent. After three years with my M50s cans, I can report that they are still as good as ever.The build quality is just excellent. When working in the studio, I would imagine that musicians are not exactly tender to their gear when concentrating on their work. One might accidentally step on the cord, pull the jack out of the socket, pull off the phones with a jerk, even step on them. They would have to survive that...and I have done all those things, but not as often as those people working with them for hours at a time, day after day. These babies are meant to take abuse and keep on working. Are they comfy for extended use? Yes, once you get them just right...not hard to adjust at all.I bought the straight cord model \"s\" as the coiled cord is a hassle for everyday stereo or TV listening, in my opinion. No complaints from me about the straight cord, just do not let puppies chew on it...it will light up their life and would require a trip back to the factory. The earpieces have a way of contouring every way you do not want them to IF you are not careful when removing them...putting them back on the same way you took them off, or it will require figuring out which is left or right, up or down, and they flip this way and that (The phones are labelled L and R, but in tiny letters...you learn right away that the left phone is the one with the cord attached to it). The M50\\'s are known for ease of adjustment...they will fit a very small head or a melon.Have had mine for about three years. They have suffered unintentional abuse from my girlfriend and me and have survived. They still have that fantastic sound. If using the M50s cans with a computer, make sure you use a quality DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) to eliminate jitter and smooth out the audio signal. The sound will immensely improve. I can highly recommend the HRT Music Streamer II DAC (A little over $130).I hope this has helped in your headphone shopping. My opinion? You landed on the right product page...these are the cans to own. They\\'ll fit your melon just fine, and make you smile.I hope this was helpful to you.

My previous pair were Sony Jbuds (in ear) and I wanted the best sound quality I could get for the price.I did my research and these are the best bang for your buck.Sound - There's really no way to express accurately in words how these headphones sound. Bass is strong, mids are pleasant, and highs are crisp and beautiful. That's talking about them separately. Everything blended together is probably the best music experience you can have under $200. I listen to a variety of music...everything from orchestra to metal, and heck even orchestral metal. I'll say this...in any good music, you have instruments playing at registers all across the board...from low to high. When you listen, you want a speaker/headphone that will let you hear it ALL. And Audio Technica ATH-M50 delivers them all. I heard sounds in songs I've listened to multiple times before on other headsets that I've never heard before. Amazing. These headphones also respond well to EQ. Any enhancement makes them better, and i can't turn them up loud enough to make them start crackling. Can they? not sure. Don't try, it may limit the life of the drivers. But they're PLENTY loud enough to rock your face off. And to make it even better...the sound will improve as the drivers are broken-in. Be patient though, that happens over 100s of hours of listening, but it does happen.Comfort - These aren't the ideal if you're on the go. I mean yeah, there are emerging styles that say it's &#34;Hip&#34; to wear headphones the size of a watermelon on your head as you walk to class. But I'm not really on their side. So I wear em at home...in the library, etc. All that said, these are pretty big, but they're as light as I think they can be. There's a ton of padding for your ears and top of the head. They're extremely comfortable and they don't squeeze too hard. Yet they cancel outside sound nicely and nobody can hear what you're listening to (only if the pads are sealed around your ears correctly) Also, I have a huge head and these fit perfectly with plenty of extra adjustment room.Durability - These are mostly plastic. There's metal inside the headband but most everything external is hard plastic. Not sure if I recommend throwing them, (that includes slinging them from your head from too much head-banging) but they should be fine if dropped accidentally.Definitely recommend these if you want superior sound and don't care how you look. But really, those who judge you in that have no idea what you're experiencing.\"},\n",

As silly as it may sound, I love the design of the cable, which is very sturdy and has a sort of &#34;spring&#34; on the jack end to prevent wire fraying that happens to most of my (tragically abused) electronic products. I initially thought that I might need an adaptor to for the jack, which is the larger size that I have on my guitar amps rather than the mini connector used on my phone and laptop. I was delighted to realize that the larger jack unscrews to reveal the smaller size underneath.They fold up a bit and fit into an included bag, which is convenient for carrying during travel, but still far from small. It's slightly bigger than a Starbucks bistro box. :) (I'm writing this from Starbucks...sorry.)Since I don't know much about audio, I can't really remark on quality except to say that the bass is far superior to any headphone I've ever used before.

       "  'review': 'Headphones are harder to compare than speakers.  With no way to do side by side comparisons with switching and impedance matching for volume control.. memory and impressions of how something sounded to you is more important.  For this listener, it is useful to break down the experience into some categories... and one of the more important bits for many can be what is sometimes referred to alternately as \"sound stage\", presence, or placement.  This characteristic tends to lump a bunch of aural clues and big \"picture\" sound into one coherent listening experience. For some, \"neutral\" within the whole--\"balanced\" is a characteristic that provides satisfaction.Got music?  Pick something you are familiar with, preferably not live music (that can contain lots of anomalies making evaluation harder).. .......Now listen. Then listen again. Close your eyes.  Listen.  What do you like?  What don\\'t you like?For personal comparison and for you to know where I have been, I currently own Sennheiser HD595, Bose QC Series 2\\'s, Razer Carcharias (gaming headset), Shure E-3, Shure SE-215 and Shure E-425 (earphones). I also briefly had a pair of Sennheiser PXC-450 Noise Cancelling headphones.  As a matter of disclosure, I tend to like a more neutral sound -with some bias towards brands like Sennheiser and their open headphones. .  For headphones and earphones I have tended towards a mid priced sweet spot of $200-300.  I have a Fiio E11 headphone amp that I use on occasion for volume control and boost.I listen to a wide variety of music but tend to concentrate mostly on ambient and/or beat oriented electronic, harder industrial rock, garage, muddy \"shoegaze\", and noise bands (not great for evaluating anything!) and a large variety of alt-folk-country-indie and corporate rock.Comments about source quality.  All CD\\'s and digital recordings are not created equal... digital engineering is an art that some engineers have not mastered even 25+ years into the medium... so I am sensitive to compression issues on CD\\'s, just as I am with compressed mp3 files on my ipod and computer.  Lots of recordings, over the broad range of current media--CD/vinyl/MP3/FLAC/etc simply have poor front end engineering and post production with too much compression or unbalanced emphasis on some aspect of the music.  Some CD\\'s dating back to the late and early 90\\'s really sound awful and have benefited from remastering. Maybe in persistent situations, blame the engineer or the artist who wanted that characteristic.  It all comes back to what you can hear, what you can\\'t hear, and what you like as a listener.I recently was back in the market for another pair of closed headphones (because I put on those Bose and was disappointed for the last time!) and was not really looking at anything in particular--but I knew I wanted some closed cup cans.  I was led to the Audio Technical ATH-M50\\'s due to a wide and enthusiastic following, probably driven by the price point and perceived quality for that price.  The number of positive reviews on Amazon and other sites for this headphone and the relatively low price made me purchase it sound unheard.Right out of the box the soft leather ear cups provide enough pressure to isolate you from the rest of the world, and do not seem too tight over extended listening.  The space inside seems large enough to properly accommodate my ears without rubbing up against driver covers.  Build quality seems high with solid plastic and metal and no obvious weak points along the cord connection or adjustable head pieces.Plugged into my computer the quality jumps out compared to the Bose.... Bose (muddy) compared to more defined M50. Bass on the AT -M50 is strong and well defined... drums do jump out slightly but not too much and with more emphasis than the more neutral Sennheiser HD595.  Subsonics in Crystal Method cuts are deep with no apparent bottom out. Vocals are upfront with a balanced presentation in the center.  On piano music, seemingly a problem for many recordings, especially as sampling rates are reduced, the M50 delivers a full range without some of the ringing I pick out occasionally. On Nine Inch Nails remastered version of Sanctified, the cymbals are bright, almost too bright. Vocals on this recording seem out of place and \"canned\".  Review of the original shows that that is exactly the way they are supposed to sound.  On Dino Lipatti played Chopin Waltzes, despite a known problem with signal to noise ratio from an early analog recording translated over to a digital medium, his piano sounds full range and front and center as it is supposed to be. No distortion in each played note. No mud. Lower notes produce balanced contrast with the faster pace middle and upper end of the piano. On Ishq\\'s Bhakti, a current and highly spatial piece I have been listening to for a couple of weeks, the upper end shimmers and persists, standing out as not super neutral or flat but sounding great nonetheless. Environmental sounds moving in space seem wide enough. The spatial placement for most listening on the M50 does not quite match the openness of the Sennheisers, but the M50 is excellent for a variety of listening.In short, these M50\\'s are far from flat and neutral, but they move in a direction that is pleasant, direct, and never overbearing in any particular way.  For this listener, pretty much what I expected.  And for the price, I have to agree with much of the crowd, these are a very good value that I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone within this price range looking for a comfortable closed ear headphone providing an excellent listening experience for most sources.

       "  'review': \"I previously owned Razer Carcharias which is primarily a gaming headset that used brand recognition to increase the price. They sat and collected dust since the first week I bought them.The ATH-M50s, unlike the Carcharias, will not be collecting dust on any shelf in my house, ever. I'll cut straight to the point with its features. The padding runs all along the inside frame. The ears are very soft and have a soft leathery feel, which can possibly cause sweating after long usages. The rotation of the ears is conveniently smooth and the headset feels very very sturdy overall. The passive noise cancellation is a good feature, it does a great job of muffling noise. Not completely, but I prefer it that way.As for the audio quality, it is wonderful. Keep in mind, I have never had a headset over ~80$. Anyway, all my music now sounds different in a good way, more clarity and depth! Whether it is your music, video game, or movie, i think you will definitely notice new instruments and sound effects that you haven't heard before.Be aware that this version of the headset comes with a coiled wire. I regret not getting the straight wire because it can't reach comfortably to the back of my PC. I will probably be returning these for the straight version.I would like to add- For anyone that wishes to get the best bang for their buck, invest in an audio amplifier. It doesn't matter what kind, but it will allow you to really crank up the noise.\"},\n",

The sound is great and balanced, unlike others in the market (cough cough Beats).  As for comfort they are great.  In the 3 weeks since i've got them i wore them for 32 hours of flights and 12 hours of bus rides and other than my ears feeling hot after many ours of use (due to the lack of ventilation) they never felt uncomfortable. This probably has to do with the fact that my ears are medium (aka normal) sized and they don't touch any part of my ear when i have them on.

They may even put to shame some of the headphones at the $200, $300 or even $400 range.At just under 40 ohms, they can be easily powered by a mp3 player without the use of an amp.  They are closed-back so to not disturb others.  The only downside is they are big and bulky.  They will not fit in your jacket pocket, believe me, I tried.  They look solid and have a somewhat retro look...quite cool in my opinion.I really dislike the pleather as it makes my ears sweaty quite often but corners have to be cut to deliver this product to you at such an amazingly cheap price.I highly recommend this product.  You simply cannot go wrong.UPDATE: These have become my favorite portable headphones.  You heard right, I was able to fit them in my jacket side pocket.  It will help if your side pocket somewhat expands out since these guys are quite big but they can be folded inward to almost like a ball.  I usually just wear them around my neck if convenient.

Virtually everything is superior to the 770s:  highs are smoother, mids are fuller, bass feels a bit punchier (although not quite as deep), soundstage is probably a tie.The biggest annoyance is that the clamping force on these is insane out of the box.  I have a large head with big ears, and yes, they fit, but at first it was almost painful to wear these for more than an hour.  They've loosened up a bit since then, but it's still a built-in reminder that you should probably take breaks every now and then to walk around and/or give your ears a rest :)Also, be careful when removing the cable.

       "  'review': \"I am listening music almost 18 hours per day, that's why I was looking for good headphones. Sometimes I need to work and any nearby conversation or TV program may disturb my concentration. The main requirements to select headphone were:1) It should be enough tight to block outer noise2) It should be worn for at least couple of hours without producing any discomfort3) It should have good quality sound so I can use it for relaxation or heavy metal music (depend on the mood)4) The parts should be strong and not easily breakable (I do not take much care of gadgets)I admit that headphones succeed almost all my expectations. The only problem I faced was quality. The advantage becomes a disadvantage in my case, let me explain: a high sensitive membrane allowed me to hear the background noise on low quality music which I did not hear before, even with my original iPod headphones. So now the only solution is listening ONLY high quality music :)With help of 3 way rotation sections, it will feet any head and block almost all noise. In hot weather it may warm your airs a bit, after one or two hours. BUT I have never had any discomfort feeling. All parts are done from good material and seemed to be strong enough.Oh, I should admit that the biggest frustration was bag!!! Come on guys, the 150USD worth headphones may come with bag out of NATURAL LEATHER, am not I right?!p.s. this headphones work fine with my iPod nano. It is a bit funny to see something small on another end of the wire LOL\"},\n",

The M50's were a definite upgrade (not a surprise for 2x the cost) but they didn't sound much better than my Turtle Beach x12's that I was hoping to replace. Because of this, I couldn't justify keeping headphones that sound roughly the same as headphones 1/3 their cost, so back they go.These headphones have a nice clear sound to them, and they are plenty loud enough. Their bass is lacking, but I think I've just become accustomed to my X12's and Sony XB-500's, both of which provide a great deal of bass. Perhaps if I started out with the M50's I would have liked them much more, but now they sound too....cold, I guess.If I find these for less than $75 one day I'll probably buy them again, but for around $120 they just don't stand out enough to replace what I already have.\"},\n",

Pleather couches and car seats are sweaty enough, these get my ears a bit musty after about 3 hours.  Replace the OEM faux-leather ear pads with the velvet ear pads, and these are amazing.Also, for the coiled cable, get a large binder-clip to carry around in your headphone pouch/case.  When using these headphones with lighter devices (such as a phone/MP3 player), clip the end near the device to the edge of your desk, table, gym equipment, or other heavy object, this way the coil will stretch without crashing your phone into the ground with callous whim of gravity.  A lot of reviews complain about the coiled cable, but when it is anchored firmly, it is great.  Especially when working or moving a lot, as a straight cable would get tangled on edges and hang too low, or, would be too short to move freely.As for the sound?  Well, they're M50's, so it's clear, detailed, and just beautiful.  It's like replacing your ears with another set of eyes that can see sound.\"},\n",

       "  'review': 'The ATH-M50s are a fantastic pair of headphones, I love them! I don\\'t do any studio work, home or professional, I don\\'t record, I\\'m not a sound designer/engineer. I\\'m simply a young teen who appreciates and loves listening to music. That being said, I listen to a wide variety of music, including Rap/Hip-Hop, Pop, Alternative, New Age, Classical, Oldies, but primarily Electronic music and Dubstep. I\\'ll break down the review into different parts so it\\'s easier to understand, rather than me writing a giant paragraph.AUDIO QUALITYExceptional. Bear in mind, these are actually the first professional studio headphones I\\'ve ever tried. I have tried Sony Outdoor headphones (casual listening), Bose Noise Cancellation Headphones, and Beats Studio by Dr. Dre, and NONE of them are even close to this kind of quality. Before these, I used my Samsung Galaxy\\'s stock earphones; which are perfect for sound isolation but poor for quality. Anyways, I love these. Treble is fairly high in most music from what I\\'ve noticed, and mids are balanced. I can now pick up minute details in the music which I could not hear before, adding to a superb studio experience. Certain lines are now easier to hear as well. Bass is very tight, and feels punchy, but now overpowering like Beats where it distorts the music. These things can also get pretty loud without an amp, but if you\\'re looking for more volume and punchier bass, it\\'s without a doubt in your best interest to seek a reasonably priced amplifier. I do have one teeny tiny complaint though. I did notice when I had my amp plugged in some very small static. I could not hear it at all in the music; only when everything was silent. I hope I didn\\'t blow a speaker already xDSound Quality: 5/5DESIGN / BUILD QUALITYThe ATH-M50s are well designed and surprisingly durable. The drivers are 45mm and the earpads seem to be some kind of plush (I apologize, not an expert on fabrics and materials). The AT logo can be seen on the drivers and the headband is also very durable and plush-like, with the words \"Audio Technica\" written across it. Since they are studio headphones, they are very flexible to ensure lots of comfort during recording. You can twist the drivers 90 degrees and even fold up the headphones to fit nicely into the carrying case provided. I have the coiled cable version, which is probably best if you do not want to lug around 12 feet of cable with you everywhere you go. Overall, I am very pleased with the aestheic appeal of the headphones, and not worried at all about breaking them.Design: 5/5Build Quality: 5/5COMFORTI don\\'t know why people are complaining that these things literally squeeze onto your head with unbearable amounts of pressure and pain- they don\\'t. I have a longer head, not a wide one, and they fit very nicely. You can adjust the headphones any way you like to get maximum comfort. The earpads, however, seem a little small for my liking. I like oversized earpads, where it\\'s nice and roomy for your ear. These are small and can make your ear sweat after 30-45 minutes of use (not a big problem for me).Comfort: 4/5Overall I\\'m very pleased with these headphones! They are relatively cheap compared to other models of their caliber, so pick them up if you\\'re looking for great quality cans!'},\n",

Can't ask for a whole lot more at this price point. Build quality is good. I prefer straight-cord headphones and these are awesome because you get a really long cord - perfect for working in a studio where you're moving back-and-forth a lot.Comes with a decent 1/8&#34; to 1/4&#34; adapter and a nice draw-string case. Headband is comfortable and if adjusted properly you don't even realize it's on your head. As with most good quality over-the-ear headphones, these will get a bit hot on your ears after awhile. Not an issue specific to this model - but if you're not used to good quality closed-ear phones be aware.A minor point that has nothing to do with sound quality - the packaging is VERY friendly and easy to open. Aside from some shrink wrap around the cord you can unbox the entire thing without tearing a single bit of the package.  So grateful for this compared to the blister-pack messes common with headphones these days.If you like closed-ear headphones and want a good, high-quality set, these will work nicely for you.\"},\n",

As wells as to be able to listen to my music and movies with out disturbing my neighbors. I also bought a head phone amplifier along with these. The Fiio E-11 which I do recommend to buy. You will hear more out of your music, movies, and TV shows and be able to crank it WAY UP! It will hurt your ears.These things are nice looking, (not as nice as the Beats audio), are sturdy, and comfortable. I use them for an average of 2-3 hrs a day, or any time I am on my computer so comfort is a must and they hold up well. After the 3 hour my ears do need a break. The cups are soft and seem durable as well.The audio quality is the reason why i bought these. After a few days of searching, looking at on line reviews and price tags, these seemed the best for the money and didnt want to go too cheep either. You do get what you pay for. But you do need to find the medium between quality and price. Like the HP and fuel usage required to move your car from 60mph to 100mph. The highs are nice and crisp (water sounds amazing), the lows are properly base filled and the midds are not over powering but do fill the gap and complete the spectrum the way mids are meant to do. For movies, they are nice. Not a surround sound system but close. In one movie their was a person walking up from behind and I thought someone was sneaking up on me. lol You hear explosions, gun shots, vocals and all other effects and parts of the movie extremely clear.For gaming, they are pretty nice-not the gaming ones but you can hear the shoot of a gun, or your enemies pretty well.For music they are what I want and need.(Its the whole reason why purchased them) I listen to mostly Electronic Dance Music, so there is a wide range of sounds, beets and various instruments and vocals and these bring all those out perfectly. They let you become immersed in your music and enjoy the full range of frequencies and sounds that you enjoy.  I do own a few other pair of headsets and my friends have tried these as well and they love them. It all depends on what your looking for but if these are near your price range I would get them or save up for them.I gave it 5 stars because basically I cannot think of any thing Audio Technica can do to improve upon these. The style is good, I guess you could improve on that but the price would be upped a lot, Quality and durability are very nice and audio is, well, the best I have listened to thus far. So for me, and a few of my friends the Audio Technica  M50s are the best for the money and the best we have had around our heads.'},\n",

They are very comfortable monitor headphones with excellent sound throughout the range, understanding that they are not intended to push the bass, mids, or highs, but reproduce sound accurately. We all have sound preferences and differences in hearing that effect our impressions of headphones. These are simply designed to play back the sound as close to what was intended as possible and for that they are very good headphones. I use other headphones for pure listening enjoyment, but they are open and emit a fair amount of noise whereas these are a bit more private.

Then I have to reposition them. That is the only negative thing I could say. I am trying to figgure out how I can wear them without having problems still not found the correct positon. :/'},\n",

These are loud but clear to me highs mids and lows are Excellent plenty of bass not booming like the sony Extra Bass Headphones which sacrifice bass for anything else but still ok, andto compare the Sennheiser HD449 Stereo Headphones (treble king 2012) if that's for u then go for it and last but not least BOSE AE2 Still can't compare to these sorry for bose heads but I was once that way. Makes u really try them out on all the old music, I did in fact heard a difference after 60+ hours of using these and still amaze how these are turning out.CONSTRUCTION: I would also give a 5 star not so easy to break and they swivel 180 degrees and they fold even dropping these from a short fall not off a 4 story apartment building won't break them, Don't let the plastic trick fool u my friend.COMFORT: I must admit the bose are far more comfortable and lift weight too!. They seem to clamp on good so it won't fall off but they can get annoying because of the material used but u can adjust right. They are heavy but like everything else time heals :D, but I'm going to give these a 3 star sorry :(Bottom line these are the best under $200 and doesn't need a amp to give these a drive. I use my ipod touch 4th Gen and I can't speak for other mp3 devices. I recommend these for anyone that's looking for superb sound, alright comfort and great construction.\"},\n",

I am not an audiophile by any means but the sound on vocals comes through a lot clearer than they did from the Beats.

       "  'review': \"I wont call my self an audiophile but here is my 2 cents to the review. I earlier had Sony MDR v6 and trust me that is really good headphone. I wanted to have an upgrade so after going thru lot of reviews I decided to get myself 2 headphones (AD700[open] & M50[closed]). Don't get me wrong, MdrV6 is an awesome headphone worth every penny but this M50 sounded even better. However mind you M50 being a studio headphone is a closed one, so it will fit tight to your ears hence wont be comfortable after say 1hr of continous listening(same with V6 but I found V6 more comfortable with beyer ear pads).The AD700 headphone is a blast, very comfortable & amazing soundstage but lacks bass(which gets a bit better overtime).M50 on the other hand has a much clear/neutral sound and better bass but lacks soundstage.Straight out of the box neither AD700 nor M50 sound good but before you pass on any judgement to these headphones let it break in for atleast 70+ hrs, makes a huge difference. I use both the headphones ATH-AD700 & ATH-M50 on my sansa clip + without an amplifier & they sound great.(M50 might sound even better with an amp but I never tested it out)These are my thoughts (comparing the 2 new headphones)AD700 (Open headphone)+ Comfort (u can wear this for 5-6 hrs stretch, very comfy)+ Soundstage (amazing soundstage - the best in any headphones ~ $100)+ Price (~ $90)+ Good gaming headphone- Soundleak (being an open headphone it will leak sound so the person sitting next to u can listen to the music u r hearing, also this is not recommended in crowded places)- Size (these are big headphones)- lacks Bass(You can listen to orchestra/instrumental music with these headphones the whole day & never get bored of it... AD700 is that good but u need a quiet place to listen to it)M50 (Closed Headphone)+ Neutral sound (as meant for studio headphones)+ Bass+ Price (for $100 this is a steal)+ Build quality (better than mdr-v6, especially the stock earpads)+ Portable- Comfort (Fits tight to ear like all closed headphones)- Lacks soundstage (better than V6 but not as good as AD700)I liked both these headphones & use it daily so I did a combined review. At the end of the day, I would say it is worth paying for these headphones... :)\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"I am going to end up repeating a lot of what has already been said, however I felt a slight obligation to write a review since I feel it can be helpful to support excellent products.I have had my eye on the M50's for a LONG time after initially reading on CNET that they were an outstanding choice.  I didn't really need a new set of headphones, but I really wanted a pair that sounded &#34;awesome&#34; for the times I really wanted to listen.  I was slightly disappointed when I recently went to J&R; to sample the M50's and found that they did not &#34;wow&#34; me, but I also did not have control of the audio source in the store.  I started trying to convince myself that maybe I should spend double to get something &#34;better&#34; despite the fact that I really didn't &#34;need&#34; headphones in the first place.  I could not shake the fact, however that so people who reviewed the M50's couldn't be wrong.  I ended up keeping a close eye on the amazon price for the M50's and when the price sank below $120 I jumped on the opportunity.The first source I used to power the headphones was an older ipod and it immediately brought a smile to my face.  The detail was there, a great amount of bass was there, and the music seemed to come alive.  I left the headphones connected for a few hours to start the burn in process and then when I got home I attached the M50's to my computer.  Despite having a laptop which is a couple of years old/outdated, the sound pumping through the M50's was even better and I could not wipe the smile from my face.My review of these headphones is based on standard MP3 files from non-optimal audio sources and I still can't believe what I have been missing.  I have not hooked them up to the home receiver yet, but that is the next step.  I have wanted &#34;audiophile&#34; type headphones for a while and I am happy.What I have learned from reading endless reviews on multiple sets of headphones on multiple sites is that there is not one universally accepted &#34;best&#34;, especially given the wide range of prices.  Everyone has their own opinions and sometimes allegiances to brands which can sway them one way or another.  I was not interested in measuring levels of audio output and db's.  Some people love the absolute technicals that comes with music, but I just wanted something that sounded awesome.For the price point, I cannot imagine I could have bought a better pair of headphones.  If you want really great headphones, then at least give these a try, especially if you are looking at Bose or Beats just because they are popular.  The M50's are a much better deal and you get a lot more for your money.  If you want bose or beats because you really want them.........then go for it, as long as it will make you happy.PROS:-Sound is fantastic (even after only using them for less than 10 hours)(supposedly it gets better with use)-Price-Seem sturdy and well made-Comfortable (* see cons below)CONS:-I personally would not consider them portable, however that is a matter of personal preference as they do fold-* I find them to be a little heavy on my head and could see them becoming uncomfortable after extended use, however I have never had headphones this big, so.......they might be the norm for their size.  Also, they are not the most comfortable set that I tried when I was looking for headphones initially.Bottom Line:  Coming from a non-technical audiophile wanna be, the price/quality ratio for the M50's is outstanding.I am very happy with my purchase and glad to know that when I want to rock out with awesome sounding headphones, I know I can.\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"The Audio-Technica ATH-M50s are the first closed-back headphones I have ever owned, and I have to admit I'm impressed. I did a lot of research on headphones with sound quality, and came across these. The reviews gave them predominantly thumbs up, and the price point was just that - on point.According to Audio-Technica's website, they weigh in at 10 ounces (without cable and connector), and after holding them they do look and feel a bit beefy. While I can see that this would be a negative to those who like near-weightless headgear, the weight made me feel assured of it's durability. Whether holding them in one hand or both, they felt more powerful, more solid, more premium. Even with them sitting on my head I actually enjoyed the added mass.They're well padded, and after trying them on for a few hours I did not notice any major discomfort, just slight warming around the back of my ears. The headband feels made out of synthetic leather, which could bother some, but what matter most to me were the ear pieces. The aforementioned, emblazoned with a sexy Audio-Technica logo (way better than the Beats by Dre logo in my opinion), swivel and fold flat, which suits my way of storing them: sitting them flat on my desktop.Now here's the first negative: Although I purchased the straight-cord version of this product to avoid being annoyed with a coiled wire (don't hate the retro-ish look, I just think it will be more of a bother trying to store), I failed to anticipate the length of the darn thing when it's straight. Is it just me or did Audio-Technica just uncoil their stock cables and not consider that it would show their true (long) length? I normally have the extra slack tied together with a string to solve the problem, but I still wish the cable to be shorter, maybe by at least a foot or two. Then again, I normally use these for leisure home use on my Macbook Pro without the 1/4&#34; attachment. I'm pretty sure the extra cordage would really prove helpful when jamming in a studio (like how the name suggests).I noticed that on some reviews that I read, some of the issues with this headphone was that it did not house an inline mic or full sound-isolating technology. While the latter is true and could be annoying for others to hear what you're listening, I have yet to experience a time where outside noise surpassed, if not conflicted, in the slightest bit my music. And as far as the headphones are concerned, judging by the size of these things I don't think these were made for mobile use in mind. I personally like how they feel as if dedicated solely to the purpose of pure, uninterrupted audio intake.Sound quality: amazing. Straight out of the packaging the highs, mids, and lows were good, and now that I have really burned them in they sound great. I care more for the tightness and precision of sounds than booming, deep bass. Yes, I said it: the bass is not that strong, but its strong enough for my tastes so as to not overpower the delicacies of the other elements in music. If the goal is to drown out everything with bass, why even have the other elements in the first place? Whether I played acoustic sessions, rock, EDM, hip-hop, R&B;, or bachata, a good tweaking of your media player's equalizer is all I (and most likely what you would) really needed. And the openness of these babies surprised me too. Nothing overbearing, all in balance, reminiscent to the detailed work of a clockmaker. Just great.I have had these cans for a little bit over a month now and I must say that the sound is phenomenal. Again, I have never owned a closed-back headphone, but I am glad I made these the first.All in all, for the price I bought them, well worth it.\"},\n",

I'm not afraid to toss them around ( I don't though because they're 'exensive' to me) or let them sit around my room.

The main problem is my head/ears get hot after maybe an hour or so. It's nothing close to unbearable but I always feel the need to lift one phone or both from my head to let my ears breathe. I also notice very minor sweat around where the earpieces sit, which may cause the cushion to degrade faster.Overall, a very comfortable fit that may get hot over longevity.Sound - 5/5I think these are perfect for what they're built for - to give a true representation of what you're listening to. The thing that blows me away is that nothing blows me away. By that, I mean that the highs, mids, and lows all blend together seamlessly. The music sounds great and I notice tons of detail that can give me a great appreciation of the work put into producing a song. I've listened to so many older, played-out stuff just to hear it with these. In fact, my inspiration for writing the review was from a YouTube video that I was watching. It was a Far Cry 3 video and the character was driving a car with the radio on.

I own several pairs of headphones (most more expensive than these) the M50s are my favorites by far.The M50s are easy to &#34;drive&#34; and sound great from your phone or mp3 player alone. If you do need more volume pair these headphones with a headphone amp (i use the Fiio E11) and get ready for a really great listening experience. The M50s sound incredible with all types of music. I use Poweramp as my music player from my Nexus 7 or Razr Maxx. Poweramp has a built in EQ that I tweak the settings (ever so slightly) to please my ear. When I set the EQ for heavy bass, these headphones can flat out thump, while still sounding spectacular. Build quality and comfort is extremely high, though comfort is subjective to the user. The outside noise isolation is great, though the leakage seems to be slightly higher than most of my other closed back headphones, not annoying but people can hear my music when i am listening at just above half volume.Highly recommeded for anyone wanting great sound at a great price.'},\n",

       "  'review': 'Wow!Received these phones from Amazon earlier this week.  Put them on, and had a late night listening session... Only got 5hrs of sleep, and tired for work the next day, but time was WELL spent.First of all, I would praise Amazon for prompt timely shipping.  Package arrived in perfect condition.  Great service all around - and I always order from Amazon when I can.  Very impressed with all my Amazon ordering up to now.  I think it\\'s best to order stuff shipped by Amazon.About the device:It comes securely packaged in it\\'s box, with plastic material protecting all the \"vitals\".  It already has the 3.5mm to \"stereo-sized\" headphone output adapter (sorry, the size escapes me at this point).  It has a nice long straight cable (you have a choice between straight and the curly one - I\\'m not a fan of the curly ones, as they tend to recoil and tug at the phones or the device they are plugged into).  The stereo end of the phones are protected by a metal spring/coil to prevent the 3.5mm jack from getting kinked/damaged.  Very nice touch.Construction of the device is superior.  Excellent fit/finish.  Looks beautiful - a little work of art.  I\\'ve used Audio Technica styluses for years, and their products are of unparalleled build and quality.  I have styluses for turntables going back to 1980 - still in use - they are THAT good.The cable from the unit goes into the left earpiece - which is great, as you have nothing hanging down in front of you (for my 1yr old daughter to grab).  It is plenty long, so if you like to put on that favourite tune and dance around the room, feel free...  The earpieces are clearly labelled \"left\" and \"right\".  Very nice silver trim on these, and the subtle Audio-Technica logos are understated and refined.How\\'d they sound?  Wow.  I haven\\'t even \"burned in\" these yet (most recommend 10s of hours of \"burn-in\"), but already the sound really put my Klipsch buds to shame (and I LIKE those buds).  Certainly was expecting more than buds anyways.  I have tried many other headphones, including Grados, Sennheisers, etc.  They all have their strengths.  I\\'m certainly not a \"head-fi\" site junkie, but I consider myself a bit of an audiophile.  I collect vintage amps/receivers (Sansui, Marantz, Yamaha, Technics, HK), have some fine speakers, and also build my own speakers.  I know, and enjoy, great sound.  These cans provide GREAT sound - at a great value (especially at the Amazon price - retail is close to double in the US, and triple in Canada).iPhone 4S users:  I am using these WITHOUT any sort of headphone amp or DAC.  I have a mixing/karaoke DAC/MIC DAC that I may try with these, but I found the sound to be loud enough, and played with the various presets on my iPhone EQ.  Also did the same on my MacBook EQ in iTunes.  My recordings are a mix of quality, but only my CDs are lossless... the downloads (many date back years) run from 128bit to 256.  They ALL sounded really good - and a marked improvement from the factory buds and even my Klipsh buds.  Will I start downloading more in the max format?  Yes.  I did pick up some defects in the 128bit recordings, and that is something that is to be expected - BUT (I\\'ll make a strong case for this) the issue was almost imperceptable.  Not a big deal.  More \"flat\" or bass-full EQ settings managed to clean it up.  The 256bit and better recordings were perfect.Listened to:  Pink Floyd, Tom Petty, David Bowie, Queen, Led Zepplin, some Tony Bennett, and even some Tupac (a little California Love).  I gotta say, I heard Tony Bennett (on my iPhone, and NO external amp/DAC) like I had never heard him before.  This was a 256bit iTunes download.  Crisp, clear, great clarity on vocals, and I could really pick up all the instruments.  Imaging was amazing.Tested video/audio from Netflix, and I was equally impressed (this was on my MacBook - late 2009 Intel Dual Core 2.4GHz, white).  I will definitely watching movies with these on.  Imaging was incredible compare to my usual night-time, movie-in-bed phones and/or buds.Do I need a portable DAC/amp?  I am seriously considering an FIIO amp/DAC.  I like the E7 or E10, but am wondering if I need a DAC?  Will it clean up some of the noise (very minor noise) from the 128bit recordings?  If so, then I\\'ll get the combo.  Otherwise, I\\'d just get the $20 FIIO amp (F6 I believe) to give me some extra low-volumes \"kick\".  The phones do make the lower volumes nice a clear, but I want that little extra \"kick\" from the sound at those listening levels.  I\\'m leaning towards the E7 for $70, but will take my time a listen some more, and read more reviews here on Amazon.Overall - 10/10 for my purposes.  I haven\\'t even tried these on one of my vintage beasts.  I will update when I do (tonight?).Audio-Technica ATHM50S Professional Monitor Headphones'},\n",

Don\\'t pass these up, this is a wonderful set of headphones.Previously I\\'d received a set of the \"Dre Beats Solo HD\" headphones as a gift; they were broken right out of the box, and the build quality was poor. The ATH-M50\\'s felt like they were built by headphone elves, or one supreme audio-smith on top of a mountain with an ancient shop. The Beats felt like something that was mass produced by 11-year-olds while they played Halo simultaneously.It may not be fair to compare the two since one is over-the-ear and the other is on-ear, one is considered \"studio monitor\" and the other isn\\'t. They may even have different target markets. But at the $150 price point, the ATH-M50 headphones make the Beats look like garbage. Audiophiles may find slights here and there, but I\\'m not a hard-core audiophile, I just like listening to my music at a comfortably insane volume with some semblance of quality.

My real name is Reid O Brown. Ok these headphones blew me away. I originally bought beats by Dre pros wch were great headphones and the best headphones that I owned at the time. Then I bought beats by Dre studio. The 1/4 inch adapter didn't even work. So I took them back and got back a 368.00 refund. Thei did my research because right now I have to mix and master all of my songs for my upcoming album Speed Kills Power Corrupts. I found a few good head phones rated by Pro Producers online. The beyerdynamic model and these were the top two. The audio techs were cheaters and had a higher rating them all so I went with these. These headphones rock up and down but I would say you must get a FiiO headphone amp to get the full studio effect to hear and mix all your hi low and mid sounds. These headphones have basically a 360 pivot in them which makes them easy to wear on either ear left or right and easy to position however they feel comfortable on your head. I have Beats by Dre, Pioneer, Bose, Technics (which I love) and now the ATH-M50s and out of all my top dollar headphones these are my favorite and best to mix and master with. They are compared to 1,200 dollar headphones out there and if you get the FiiO per amp with them then they shut down all of the other competition period. I thought that Audio Technica was a cheap knock off of Technics when Pani shut down but now my eyes have been opened to the glory of good products built for a budget. I'm V.i.P the current Guinness World record holder for longest freestyle rap and this brand and veer my my stamp of endorsement and approval. Thanks guys.\"},\n",

I tried them all (Solo HD, Studio, Mixr, Pro\\'s).  I was pretty set on buying the Studios until I started searching for alternatives.  Everybody seemed to recommend the ATH-M50\\'s so I got curious and went back to a local audio store to test them.  Within seconds of putting them on, I was SOLD!  I went back to the Beats (all 4) for a sound comparison.  The ATH-M50\\'s is balanced with the right amount of highs, mids and lows.  In comparison, the Beats sounded muffled and the bass was just way too \"enhanced/exaggerated\"Shortly after my purchase, I found an easy DIY mod (requires solder skills).  After a visit to radio shack, and a hour or so of taking it apart and soldering, my M50\\'s has the detachable cable feature(google ATH-M50 cable mod for additional info).  Now if the wire breaks, I can easily replace it for $15 rather than buying a new pair of headphones.  I even picked up an extra cord with the iPhone control talk buttons (volume control, take/end calls, start, skip & stop music).All in all, I spent $105 for the M50\\'s + $25 in parts for the mods.  My M50\\'s sound 10x better than any of the Beats\\'s I\\'ve tried.  So in conclusion if you want nothing but a good looking pair of headphones that has way too much bass, pick up a pair of Beats for 3-4x the price. If you want an amazing/balanced pair of headphones for around $100, there\\'s nothing better than these M50\\'s.'},\n",

I've always thought the V6's had a very full and rich hi-fi sound, but to my surprise, they sounded relatively tinny and harsh compared to the M50's!Of course the M50's cost about twice as much, but they have a more natural and clear sound with more bass overall, which also surprised me. If I had to nitpick, the M50's occasionally sounded a bit muffled in the low-mid frequencies (perhaps that freq is overboosted?) but I wonder if that will change after they break in or maybe I'm just not use to it. They also are very sealed and made my ears hot after wearing them for some time.The Sony's are a bit lighter and I would say also more comfortable, probably because they've been worn a lot, but the build quality of the AT's is slightly better.The V6's are still excellent headphones and the fact that they are still on the market after 20+ years is amazing in itself, but the M50's are just better overall.So if you were like me and didn't have a chance to audition headphones in person and had to base your decision on reading reviews, I definitely recommend the M50's.

The music was crisper cleaner and clearer than any other of my headphones or my in house full size speaker system. I heard things I had not heard before and the instruments came from where you expeced them to come from. My next test was the March 1954 recording in SACD of Also Sprach Zarathustra with Reiner and the CSO.

I finished my test with 6th movement of Mahler's Symphony No 3 with the Pittsburgh Symphony and Honeck on an Exton 2 channel SACD HQ recording. Again the 50's were great.

       "  'review': 'I\\'m trying to write the review I wish I had a month ago. I sat and read through countlessreviews before making my final decision.  I currently have an older pair of ath-m40fs thatare still made in Japan but with really loud intense music they almost sound blown. Thesem50\\'s are made in China.  I wanted a new pair and was definitely going back to AudioTechnica. When I got them in and plugged them in I was really disappointed, well actuallyangry. The bass response is unusually heavy with these m50\\'s.  Well maybe the m40\\'s arereally lacking on the low end? After the first night I kept them plugged in playing musicfor 24 hours at a moderate volume so the next night I could really compare the 2. Usually Ilisten to music through my Martin Logan ESL\\'s. I\\'ve been recording music for 15 years andplay drums, guitar, bass guitar, piano, cello and banjo. I randomly chose music that Ilisten to frequently and know very well. I also tried to pick a semi wide range of music andonly songs that I own in very high quality or at least as high as possible. All of mycomparisons were at really loud volumes. I also had my wife&#8217;s headphones nearby so I comparedthem too (Skullcany Mesh). One major difference I should mention is volume outside theheadphones.  Every time I put on my old m40\\'s my wife would look over and say turn em down,the other 2 were a lot quieter on the outside according to her. Overall I\\'m glad I have bothbut I really wish half or more of my possessions weren\\'t made in China. Would have given 4 or 5 stars but these should be $50 if they are made in China so I give 2.Rush tom sawyerath-m50Not bad overall. Mid to upper range undefined.

The snare makes me melt.Skullcandy HeshWas that Peter Gabriel, please skullcandy give me 5:05 of my life back.Primus Too many puppiesath-m50  winnerThese are actually way better for this song.  Lar on guitar is buried but this is Primusyou didn\\'t come for the guitar.ath-m40fsIntro actually sounds like train crossing.  Sounds like a band and not a bass player.Skullcandy HeshHonestly I\\'m starting to feel arrogant but the only thing I can say is...... well they makesound.Flo Rida  Lowath-m50  winnerFar superior for this song. The bass actually sounds like you\\'re at a traffic light next tothat guy that you won\\'t look over at. Vocals and the \"music\" come through very well. I thinkthe producer was wearing these when he did this song.ath-m40fsI can hear the bass hits a little but they aren\\'t what they are supposed to be.Skullcandy HeshI hear bass and vocals, if this is music you listen to then these will work.Roy Orbison uptownath-m50 winnerPreferred the mix overall but can\\'t decide why exactly.ath-m40fsVocals were slightly more heart melting. Sounded like a much more dated recording on these.Skullcandy HeshStill a good song?Dave Matthews Band  Ants marchingath-m50Very clean and clear. Vocals sit back nicely.  Bass drives well.ath-m40fsVocals almost too upfront.  High hats majorly better.  Snare is probably the best recordedsnare ever.

Reason being, I own the M50 and my brother has the 598 and it would be a naturally upgrade if one does decide to step up one level in price range.Conclusion, the 598 costs more for a reason.build/aesthetics: 598 blows m50 out of the water here, the wood accents is gorgeous, seems sturdier than the m50 as those are more plastic.comfort: 598 also takes edge. ear pad are more comfortable than the pleather pads of the M50 that will get hot over time. in general, both pretty comfortable for their price ranges.sound: 598 is more well rounded, more balanced. After having listened to them, the high notes on the M50 seems shrilled. Both have balanced bass but the M50 is a bit deeper it seems. On the same neutral equalizer, sound is definitely more pleasant with the Sennheiser. The 598 are open back where as m50 is closed, so the soundstage is clearly better with the Sennheisers, M50 feels in-your-head (for lack of better description) in comparison.others: the 598 has detachable cable where as the m50 doesn't.I know it's not fair to compare two cans on different levels (and different purposes). That is not to say that both are not great value. for home studio where exterior noise will not be an issue, i would spend the extra 100 or so to get the HD598 and a nice amp. For travel, the m50 will work great with a little bit of EQing, and both headphones are driven pretty well with standard Smartphone/ipod/mp3 drivers.\"},\n",

       "  'review': 'I have been using a garbage set of headphones for my music listening and decided to upgrade to a different pair.  Let me preface my review with this statement - I am by no means an audiophile.  I don\\'t know any fancy technical terms to explain how great these sound, but I will give you my honest opinion.  My previous set of headphones were EverGlide ones I bought cheap off of Woot.  My setup includes a Yamaha Receiver with a Standard CD player and also my PC piped into the receiver via optical connection.So far I have about four hours on these headphones, and fit is tight, but not uncomfortable for my fat head.  I have played a few cds and also some audio from my pc.  I have ranged the music from Fear Factory, Red, Lamb of God, Harry Connick Jr, and even some Cee Lo Green.  I will say these headphones provide such a great range to all the various types of music I tried out.  They just seem to put out \"more\" of the songs, if that makes any sense.  They just sound great.  It doesn\\'t matter what you play through them.  One thing is I understand they will also \"break in\" after a while and sound even better.  I cannot wait to see how they sound after that.  Well worth the money I paid for them.'},\n",

       "  'review': 'It is somewhat unfair to compare these to the Sennheiser HD 650\\'s on the basis of fidelity. It is also unfair to compare them on the basis of price. But subjectively, if I were to compare them on the fidelity/price ratio, the ATH-M50 wins outright.I was comparing these two with my friend, listening to \"Home at Last\" - Steely Dan. I have to say that the Sennheiser\\'s had a richer sound, you can hear the actual sounds of opening and closing valves on the brass. BUT, the ATH-M50 had a much more encompassing sound. The closed back really presents all of the track without the feeling that \\'you could hear more\\' like I get with the open ear phones. I don\\'t know how to explain it that well, I would not consider myself an audiophile.From a practical standpoint, you can take these with you while traveling. You wouldn\\'t want to take $500 dollar head phones with you. Also, with the closed back, you can listen to music without bothering the people around you. This is not possible with the open-ear variety of headphones.Before I bought these, I looked at all the other phones in this price point. Of particular interest was that MDR7506. I can\\'t compare to those because I don\\'t have them, I will update this review if I get the opportunity to use them.I can say, from the standpoint of a picky shopper, you won\\'t be disappointed. I took the leap and bought them without listening to them and I was rewarded for my faith in my fellow reviewers. If the price is right, get em.'},\n",

       "  'review': \"I am not in the music business or do any type of work tied to music.  I'm just a normal guy that was looking for some headphones to play music off my ipod at work.  I listen to all sorts of music with most of my music purchases consisting of things I heard off the radio. With that said, I love these headphones.  In the past, I mostly spent $15-$50 on in-ear headphones and never noticed the difference between a cheap pair or a more expensive pair.  I decided to purchase this based upon the positive reviews and could not be happier.  When I played Rolling in the Deep by Adele, I was blown away.  The voice and instruments sounded perfect, I just sat there, closed my eyes and just smiled.  There is such a huge difference.  Classical, Rock, Rap, R&B;, Country, Alternative, whatever, it plays everything really good.  You are able to start picking out instruments that you previously did not hear.  I tried the Bose over the ear headphones from the local Best Buy display...and they do not even come close to how good these sound.Things to consider for people looking to purchase:1.  The difference between the M50 and the M50S is whether you want a coiled cord (M50) or straight cord (M50S).  I purchased the coil as I was just using it to listen to my ipod and did not want to deal with a long cord that I would probably need to coil up.2.  If you do purchase, the band is very tight around your ears to the point of causing some painful pressure.  Recommendation by another reviewer of using a tissue box to break it in worked great.  After a couple of days it was very comfortable to wear.  Although I still have issues of wearing this for a full 8 hr day.  I normally have to take a break after 6 hrs.3.  Burning them in...I tried it...did not notice a difference.  Doing a google search says this is an unproven concept that some people believe they can hear a change and some think it is a joke.

I am sure there is sufficient review on their capabilities and I will not cover them here.2. Coiled cable is long but manageable and is better than uncoiled longer version.3. The 3.5mm jack is a little stout and it is a little struggle to plug in properly into a phone or ipad which has a cover. I have to remove the Seideo cover which I use before I use it on my Galaxy S3. On my iPad with SmartCase cover, I can use it without removing the cover but it is a little struggle.4. Cheeks do get warm after about an hour of use but I would think this would be the case with any closed over-the-ear headphones. Definitely cannot be used for long time outside on a hot day.5. Slightly bigger than most other headphones and it will obstruct if you are lying down on a pillow and try to use the headphones.6. The included pouch is good but does not provide sufficient protection. I ended up buying a CaseBudi case which perfectly fits for these headphones.  CaseBudi case is an excellent companion for this product.7.When you are watching a movie with these headphones, the audio feels very close to you while the image is farther and this may feel a little weird until you get used to this.Overall, an excellent buy and probably best bang for the buck.'},\n",

       "  'review': \"After listening to a friends 'Beats by Dr. Dre' made by monster, I decided that I needed a quality set of headphones.  Although the Beats sound was great, the bass seemed a little over the top.  It is to be expected considering the style of music that they were most likely designed around.  The $300 price tag was a definite no-go for this guy.  I have been DJing amateurly for about eight years and spin mostly Drum and Bass and some Hip-Hop from time to time.  I personally listen to a wide variety of music, from Sinatra to Death metal, Country to glitch and continue to explore all of music.  I am learning to produce with Reason 5 and that was also one of the main factors that pushed me to invest in a nice set of cans. Here is my review set up in a pros/cons format.PROS:-The highs are VERY crisp.  At certain volumes a crash or high-hat could possibly damage your hearing.  They are remarkable.-The Mids are extremely well rounded and to the point where you could almost notices breathing in lyrics that were not caught in post-production editing on the track.  They really tie the highs and lows together-The lows are completely balanced and warm, I really can say in comparison to the beats that I am in fact, more impressed with the M50's-The build of the headphone is SOLID, they are not flimsy or cheap feeling in the slightest.  They are extremely tough looking while remaining sharp.-The padding is comfortable and the tension after a few sessions becomes perfect (as expected, they are not custom made after all).-The straight cable is well over four feet (estimate) and has a quality gold-plated contact.  The 1/4 inch jack adapter is threaded (you must screw it on) which is always a sign of quality.  Some adaptors just snap on.CONS (I really have to dig)-The headphones sound so nice that I am starting to realize the quality of some of the songs in my collection are not as of great quality as I thought when I purchased them.  (not really a con, just a bummer for me)-The Cable is at times really to long for what I am doing and I am sometimes worried that I might accidently damage the cable by stepping on it, getting it caught on something, etc. (I am clumsy from time to time, not AT's fault)  I added a velcro wrap that keeps it in place nicely. Maybe adding something to manage the cable would be nice, definitely not something that would cause me to ever shy away from AT products in the future. It is better to have more than less in the end.-The pleather bag is a bit small, it would be nice if the opening was maybe a little bit bigger.  I notice myself almost cramming them into the bag when I put them away.  Also, a little velcro pouch on the outside to hold onto the adapter would be nice.  I already lost my adapter, I was keeping it in the bag. While traveling from Germany to Afghanistan, I had made many stops and had to take them out and put them away a few times before I got settled in and it dropped out somewhere on one of my legs of travel.  In the end, it is my fault.OVERALL:I paid $160 for these, some are saying that they found them for around $100 and I am not heart broken that I payed $160 for them. The $60 dollars change would be nice, but they are at least worth what I paid.  They have changed they way listen to music and watch movies They have really improved my quality of life while in Afghanistan.

       "  'review': 'After reading so many brilliant reviews by such seasoned audiophiles, (including CNET) I decided to purchase them.  I have previously owned Sennheiser and JBLs. I was eager to try them, despite their relatively high price ($115). I do travel quite a bit, and was looking for a balance between good sound and noise-cancellation (oh, those crying babies and yackety passengers...especially when they repeatedly shuffle cards).BIG disappointment:1) The RIGHT earpiece was defective.  I couldn\\'t rotate the cup onto my ear.2) The overall size was humongous. These are NOT readily portable.3) The cable is much too long; even the coiled type (9 feet): tripping, then strangling myself...no way.4) There is no mute control.5) The volume was much too low.No wonder those near you can\\'t hear your music. Consider buying the Amplifier.6) The carrying pouch is a joke. A glorified stocking.7) Noise cancellation is nothing to write home about. Babies crying...oh, no.8) Two pages of \"instructions\" in a dozen languages basically told you nothing important.9) Now I have to send them back at MY expense.  Not a good thing. Sorry.'},\n",

The Sound is incredible and I feel like I can hear everything in every song. Simply amazing. They fit great on my head (I wear a 7-3/8 hat) and I have never had any pain with these on my head. When not on my head, the feel and build quality is impeccable! All my friends have Studio Beats, but I feel like I got a better pair of headphones for half as much! MY ONLY COMPLAINT - too long of a cord. Why must the cord be 6 feet?! its simply too long. For these headphones to be perfect, I would love to see a detachable cord with two options (a 3 ft and 6 ft). That allows for a studio recorder to have longer line while an average user could have their desired length as well! Thats really it, I highly recommend these headphones to anyone. They are amazing.'},\n",

The build quality is very very good. I was a little concerned when these came and i saw the very minimal packaging but the inner box and headphones came perfect no scratches nicks or anything like that. I've had some experience with v-moda m80's and even though those are very good (higher build quality) headphones when it comes to music they simply do not compare. These have a much much bigger sound stage and have amazing clarity. The bass is astounding like nothing I've ever heard before. The highs are not pinched or whiny at all. I was completely blown away when I plugged these in for the first time. I heard so many details in my music that I never heard before (even with the m80's). The vocals are incredibly clear and the isolation for these is much better than any other headphones I've ever owned. I couldn't recommend these more.

They spend over $200 bucks.  I tried it on myself and I was amazed at the quality, and you do not need a base booster. Take if from a very conservative shopper, you get good quality for less price. What about the detachable jack in the Beats? It's all about personal preference.  If you never used detachable jack, you will not miss it. Honestly, I would not want my son to walk around with his headphones anyway. You can't hear anything, when this things are on. It might be my old age. I am proud of my purchase\"},\n",

Don't believe me, check out the reviews from Stereophile Magazine or headfi.org for their take on these.  Others have commented on the frequency response and other technical aspects, so I will not go into that.  If you want a set of headphones that sound good and are not overly bass heavy, these are the ones.  The only downside is that the ear cups were uncomfortable.  I tried after market ear cups and they changed the sound too much.  So I kept wearing them and wearing them and after awhile, they got broken in and now I can wear them for 3 hours and while they do get warm, they are not uncomfortable.\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"I'm an amateur musician and have been using the Sennheiser HD280 Pro headphones for some years when doing my recording or jamming without bugging the neighbors ;) I've always been very happy with those but these ATH-M50 headphones sound so much better and reveal so much more detail in my sound that I never heard with the Sennheisers before. They also seem to handle high volumes better than the Sennheiser which sometimes could get a bit distorted when the bass is extremely low and heavy. I don't have that problem with the ATH-M50 at all and no matter how loud i crank these up, there is just no noticable distortion.I also find these more comfortable to wear than the Sennheisers which used to give me very warm and somewhat painful ears during a long session. These Audio-Technica ones feel great, fit perfectly and are pushing tight enough on my ears to give that nice low end bass, but without becoming painful or uncomfortable when wearing them for several hours. I am very happy with these and expect that they will last a long time too judging by the way they are made. Very high quality product and highly recommended!\"},\n",

After about a 100 hour break-in period, they were excellent.  Very good from the low through high frequency range (unlike many byDre which were focused too much on bass, or several others too focused on treble).- Comfort and quality are also 5 out of 5.  Very durable and do not press on your head uncomfortably when listening for extended period of time.- Appearance, very good.  Subtle and don't stick out as just one of the group.- Price is unmatched.  There is no other set of headphone that can match the quality or other product attributes for the price which the ATH-M50s are offered.Negative:Honestly, I do not have any.  I always review products and list at least a couple of negatives, but I have none with regards to these ATH-M50s and I've owned them for over a year, listening to them daily.\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"Pros: Great Quality at an Affordable price, 11 ft cable is useful for amps or stereos, ComfortableCons: 11 ft cable if you're also using it for portable use, and the fact that you never want to take them offAlright so first off, like every other reviewer here, I read so many reviews on these headphones and was very hesitant on buying them based off all the positive reviews and the price, it was pretty unbelievable that these were THAT good.Yeah, these headphones are THAT good. The best purchase I've made on Amazon, hands down. So I just had to write a review on them to back up other users and I also got the chance to compare them to the Solo HD beats and my old headphones the Sony xb500's, and these beat them both by far. If I had to rank them, the Solo's would actually be last, and they're actually twice the price ($200) of these and almost 5 times the price I got my xb500's for ($45), so if that's the quality of the Solo's, I wouldn't even think about considering the beats Studios or even the Pros.The quality of the M50's is just amazing, especially for the price. You can hear everything, crisp and clear, and the bass sounds like REAL bass. At first I thought &#34;okay, well it doesn't have as much bump as the xb500's&#34; but after listening for a while and then going back to the xb's, I couldn't believe they were the same headphones. The bass on them was too overpowered and drowned out some high's and the vocals, and I after 10 seconds of listening I had to go back to the M50's. I still love my xb's and I'll still use them if I really want my ears to bump, but you just can't beat the clarity of the M50's.I then borrowed my friend's Solo HD's just to see how they matched up to the M50's and after not even 5 seconds of listening I just thought, &#34;Ugh! This is what beats sound like?!&#34; But I kept listening and they just weren't getting any better. The vocals were so muffled, the bass was muddy and centered in one place, they just sounded cheap. I mean granted they're on-ear headphones but still, $200 for that quality? I really didn't want to believe that they were that bad but I can't believe people buy these.As far as comfort goes, I prefer the M50's over the 3. The Solo's are pretty comfortable and compact so they're the lightest on your head. The xb500's have the most comfortable ear cups I've ever felt and they're pretty light for they're bulkiness. With that being said, I prefer the M50's because while they may be a little bit more heavier and larger, it feels very balanced and you can't even tell they're on once they're on. and the swivel on the cups is a treasure I didn't realize how much I would appreciate until I had the option. You can wear these headphones any way you want to that makes you comfortable, and without looking like an idiot at that.The one and only con I have about these headphones is actually also a plus in my book as well. The 11 foot cable makes it easy to move around freely when you have them plugged into an amp for an instrument or the stereo for your tv for movies and/or video games, which I love since I don't have to use an extender and I can use it with the screw-on 1/4 inch jack. BUT, for portable use with a cell phone, mp3 player or handheld console/tablet, that extra cable gets in the way. My current solution is just to bundle up the excess with a twist tie, which works out alright, but it's still more to put in your pocket.In conclusion, I am over-satisfied with these headphones. They're so good that I never want to take them off! I highly recommend these to anyone who loves sound quality and at this price it's hard to find a pair that beat these. If you've read more than 10 reviews on here on these headphones then just buy them already! You won't be disappointed!\"},\n",

       "  'review': 'Although most of the reviews for these headphones are very positive, some of the nitpics are very similar to the complaints about the Audio Technica ATHM40fs (fs equating to flat response for monitoring), an even cheaper but just as impressive set of monitor headphones (they also offer the ATHD40fs which have an \"enhanced\" bass response for those that expect subwoofer sound out of a can...). I find reviews for monitor style headphones in general to be somewhat misleading. Unlike many \"audiophile\" phones which offer a very rich listening environment with deep bass, these are technically not \"audiophile\" headphones. Many \"audiophile\" phones achieve their sound through enhanced/tailored and/or filtered response and in fact can often color the sound, although in a pleasing way. These are pro studio monitoring headphones and by design are intended to give a very flat and uncolored response across the entire frequency spectrum so they can be used to mix and master recorded material. The Audio Technica\\'s are designed to provide as exact a reproduction of the sound going in as possible which in effect means they are designed to expose every flaw in the recorded material. The whole point is if you can make it sound really good with these headphones, it will pretty much sound okay on anything, up to the capabilities of the device playing the material. However, if you are simply a \"listener\" and not someone that mixes audio, \"studio monitor\" or \"monitor\" style headphones might not be right for you. Be sure you understand exactly what it is the phones are designed to do before you decide on a purchase. That being said, if you want pure, uncolored and non enhanced reproduction of your listening material both these and the ATHM40fs are excellent!'},\n",
