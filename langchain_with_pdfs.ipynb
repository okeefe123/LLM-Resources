As soon as she was small enough toget through the door, she ran out of the house,and found quite a crowd of little animals andbirds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard,Bill, was in the middle, being held up by twoguinea-pigs, who were giving it something outof a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice themoment she appeared, but she ran off as hardsilence, and then another confusion of voices—\\n“Hold up his head—Brandy now—Don ’t choke\\nhim—How was it, old fellow?

Tell us all about it !”\\nLast came a little feeble squeaking voice,\\n(“That’s Bill,” thought Alice,) “Well, I hardly\\nknow—No more, thank ’ye, I ’m better now—but I ’m a deal too flustered to tell you—allI know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket !”\\n“So you did, old fellow !” said the others.\\n“We must burn the house down !” said the\\nRabbit’s voice, and Alice called out as loud asshe could, “If you do, I ’ll set Dinah at you !”\\nThere was a dead silence instantly, and Alice\\nthought to herself, “I wonder what they will\\ndo next ! If they had any sense, they’d takethe roof off.” After a minute or two theybegan moving about again, and Alice heard theRabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”\\n“A barrowful of what?” thought Alice; but\\nshe had not long to doubt, for the next moment\\nNavigate Control InternetFit Page Full Screen On/Off Close Book', metadata={'source': \"./data/01.
